            Perform a DIFFERENTIAL code review. Only review the CHANGES in this PR.

            Steps:
            1. Run `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` to see what changed
            2. Read CLAUDE.md for project conventions
            3. Review the changed code for:
               - Bugs or logic errors
               - Security issues
               - Convention violations (from CLAUDE.md)
               - Missing tests for new code
               - Type safety issues

            Use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` for specific line feedback.
            Use `gh pr comment` for summary feedback.

            Be concise. Focus on actionable issues. Don't comment on unchanged code.

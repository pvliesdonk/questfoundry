## Type of issue

- [ ] **TU (Trace Unit) — propose scoped work within current rules**
- [ ] **ADR Proposal — change the rules (roles, bars, SoT, loops, layout)**
- [ ] **Docs Bug — links, typos, structure clarity**
- [ ] **Question / Discussion**

> Use **TU** for normal work (loops/playbooks). Use **ADR** only to change policy. See `DECISIONS/README.md` and `00-north-star/TRACEABILITY.md`.

## Summary (one-liner)

<What’s the essence of this issue, in human terms?>

---

## Context & Motivation

<What problem or friction did you hit? Player comprehension, PN phrasing, spoiler risk, link integrity, style drift, etc. Cite where it occurred.>

---

## Scope & Impact

- **Layer(s):** `Layer-0 | Layer-1` (don’t edit 3–7 here)
- **Surfaces touched (if any):** `manuscript | PN | codex | captions | audio text | translations | none`
- **Optional roles to wake (if any):** `Researcher | Art | Audio | Translator | none`

## For TU issues (fill this block)

**Loop alignment:** `story_spark | hook_harvest | lore_deepening | codex_expansion | style_tune_up | art_touch_up | audio_pass | translation_pass | binding_run | narration_dry_run | docs/policy`

**Inputs on screen:**  
<Which docs/snapshots/hooks this TU depends on?>

**Deliverables:**  
<What you expect at the end of the loop run (Codex Pack, Style Addendum, Canon Pack, etc.)>

**Quality Bars likely pressed:**  
`Integrity | Reachability | Nonlinearity | Gateways | Style | Determinism | Presentation`

**Risks & Mitigations:**  
<Short bullets (e.g., Researcher dormant → mark uncorroborated:low)>

## For ADR proposals (fill this block instead)

**Decision to make:**  
<Concise rule you want to adopt/change>

**Why now:**  
<Loops or findings motivating the change; links to prior issues/TUs>

**Consequences:**  

- Positive: <…>  
- Risks: <…> (migration plan below)

**Migration plan:**  
<Exactly which files/sections change; indices to update; any deprecations>

---

## Acceptance criteria (definition of done)

- [ ] Player surfaces remain **spoiler-safe** and accessible
- [ ] Links/anchors resolve (Integrity)
- [ ] Hand-offs clear (which loop comes next, who owns it)
- [ ] Indices updated (`LOOPS/README.md`, `PLAYBOOKS/README.md`, Layer-0 README) if applicable

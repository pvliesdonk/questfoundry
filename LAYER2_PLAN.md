# Layer 2 Implementation Plan

> **Goal:** Create "Common Language" as human-readable data dictionary bridging Layer 0/1 concepts to Layer 3 schemas
>
> **Scope:** Good coverage without redundancy - depends on L0/L1 for context, focuses on data structures and taxonomies
>
> **Approach:** Hybrid (automated extraction â†’ human review â†’ iteration â†’ finalization)

## Proposed Phase Order

### **Phase 1: Taxonomies** ðŸŽ¯ START HERE
**Why first:** Everything else references these classifications
**Effort:** Medium (extract from L0, consolidate, extend)
**Risk:** Low (mostly exists scattered across L0/1)

### **Phase 2: Field Registry**
**Why second:** Needs taxonomies for enum type definitions
**Effort:** High (parse 17 artifacts, deduplicate, classify)
**Risk:** Medium (requires careful deduplication)

### **Phase 3: Artifacts Refinement**
**Why third:** Now we have taxonomies and fields to reference
**Effort:** Medium (enrich existing 17 templates)
**Risk:** Low (incremental improvements to existing)

### **Phase 4: Validation Rules**
**Why fourth:** Needs fields and taxonomies to express rules
**Effort:** Medium (extract from L0/1 policies)
**Risk:** Medium (needs careful policy interpretation)

### **Phase 5: Relationships**
**Why fifth:** Builds on complete understanding of artifacts
**Effort:** Medium (map flows between artifacts)
**Risk:** Low (mostly documentation of existing flows)

### **Phase 6: Glossary Enhancement**
**Why sixth:** Final polish after all structures defined
**Effort:** Low (augment existing glossary.md)
**Risk:** Low (refinement only)

### **Phase 7: Finalization**
**Why last:** Remove PARKED markers, final consistency check
**Effort:** Low (cleanup and documentation)
**Risk:** Low

## Phase 1 Detail: Taxonomies

### Deliverables

**File:** `02-dictionary/taxonomies.md`

**Sections to create:**

1. **Hook Types** (extract from `00-north-star/HOOKS.md` + `01-roles/templates/hook_card.md`)
   - `narrative` - Story entities, locations, stakes, topology
   - `scene` - Scene-level details, traits, props, micro-events
   - `factual` - Real-world claims to verify
   - `taxonomy` - Coverage gaps, cross-ref needs
   - `style/pn` - Voice, register, phrasing patterns
   - `translation` - Localization needs
   - `art` - Visual requirements
   - `audio` - Sound requirements
   - `binder/nav` - Export and navigation issues
   - `accessibility` - A11y concerns

2. **Hook Status Lifecycle**
   - `proposed` â†’ `accepted` â†’ `in-progress` â†’ `resolved`
   - `proposed` â†’ `deferred` (with reason)
   - `proposed` â†’ `rejected` (with reason)
   - `resolved` â†’ `canonized` (appears in Cold)

3. **TU Types & Loop Alignment** (extract from `00-north-star/LOOPS/`)
   - Story Spark â†’ topology/structure TUs
   - Hook Harvest â†’ triage TUs
   - Lore Deepening â†’ canon TUs

   - `reputation` - Social standing thresholds
   - `knowledge` - Information discovered
   - `physical` - Location, capability, tool access
   - `temporal` - Time-based constraints
   - `composite` - Multiple conditions (AND/OR)

5. **Quality Bar Categories** (extract from `00-north-star/QUALITY_BARS.md`)
   - **Integrity** - Anchors resolve, no orphans, IDs unique
   - **Reachability** - Keystones accessible, no unreachable sections
   - **Nonlinearity** - Hubs/loops matter, choices non-trivial
   - **Gateways** - Fair paths exist, diegetic enforcement
   - **Style** - Voice consistent, register appropriate, motifs tracked
   - **Determinism** - Reproducibility logged when promised
   - **Presentation** - No spoilers/meta on surfaces, accessibility baseline

6. **Artifact Status Types** (extract from artifact templates)
   - `draft` - Initial creation in Hot
   - `review` - Submitted for gatecheck
   - `blocked` - Failed bars, needs remediation
   - `approved` - Passed bars, ready for Cold
   - `merged` - Landed in Cold snapshot
   - `published` - Included in exported view

7. **Deferral Types** (extract from `01-roles/interfaces/dormancy_signals.md`)
   - `deferred:art` - Visual work postponed
   - `deferred:audio` - Sound work postponed
   - `deferred:translation` - Localization postponed
   - `deferred:research` - Fact-checking postponed

8. **Research Posture Levels** (extract from `01-roles/briefs/researcher.md`)
   - `uncorroborated:low` - Minor claim, low player impact
   - `uncorroborated:medium` - Significant claim, moderate impact
   - `uncorroborated:high` - Critical claim, high impact (requires immediate attention)

9. **Role Dormancy States** (extract from `01-roles/interfaces/dormancy_signals.md`)
   - `always-on` - Showrunner, Gatekeeper
   - `default-on` - Plotwright, Scene Smith, Lore Weaver, Codex Curator, Style Lead
   - `optional-dormant` - Researcher, Art Director, Illustrator, Audio Director, Audio Producer, Translator
   - `downstream` - Book Binder, Player-Narrator

10. **Loop Types** (create classification)
    - **Discovery loops** (Hot-primary): Story Spark, Hook Harvest, Lore Deepening
    - **Refinement loops** (Hotâ†’Cold): Style Tune-up, Codex Expansion
    - **Asset loops** (optional): Art Touch-up, Audio Pass, Translation Pass
    - **Export loops** (Cold-only): Binding Run, Narration Dry-Run
    - **Validation loops** (cross-cutting): Gatekeeper checks at all stages

### Extraction Strategy

**Automated extraction (I do):**
```bash
# Extract hook types from HOOKS.md
grep -A5 "hook types" 00-north-star/HOOKS.md

# Extract Quality Bars
grep -A3 "^###" 00-north-star/QUALITY_BARS.md

# Extract loop names
ls 00-north-star/LOOPS/*.md | xargs -n1 basename | sed 's/\.md//'

# Extract status enums from templates
grep -rh "Status:" 02-dictionary/artifacts/ | sort -u

# Extract deferral tags
grep -rh "deferred:" 01-roles/
```

**Manual consolidation (you review):**
- Verify completeness of each taxonomy
- Add missing values I didn't catch
- Clarify decision criteria for choosing values
- Ensure terminology is consistent with L0/L1

### Template Structure (for each taxonomy)

```markdown
## Taxonomy: [Name]

**Purpose:** [Why this classification exists - 1 sentence]

**Defined in Layer 0/1:** [References to source documents]

**Values:**
- `value1` â€” [Description: when to use, what it means]
- `value2` â€” [Description: when to use, what it means]
- ...

**Usage:**
- Appears in: [Which artifacts use this taxonomy]
- Used by: [Which roles make these classifications]
- Examples: [Player-safe examples]

**Decision Criteria:** [How to choose between values - if not obvious]

**Validation:**
- Must be one of the listed values
- [Any other constraints]
```

- Mark Hot vs Cold safety
- Define constraints and formats

### Phase 3: Artifacts Refinement
**Files:** All `02-dictionary/artifacts/*.md`
- Add field type annotations
- Reference taxonomies from Phase 1
- Add more examples

- Artifact flow diagrams (TU â†’ Hooks, Canon â†’ Codex)
- Cardinality (one-to-many, many-to-many)
- Required vs optional relationships
- Lifecycle connections (TU â†’ Snapshot â†’ View)

### Phase 6: Glossary Enhancement
**File:** `02-dictionary/glossary.md`
- Add missing terms discovered in Phases 1-5
- Cross-reference to taxonomies

## Next Step: Phase 1 Kickoff

**I will:**
1. Extract hook types, statuses from Layer 0/1
2. Extract Quality Bar categories
3. Extract loop types and classifications
4. Create draft `taxonomies.md` with all 10 sections
5. Present for your review

**You will:**
1. Review extracted taxonomies
2. Mark missing values or incorrect classifications
3. Clarify decision criteria where needed
4. Approve or request iteration

**Ready to start Phase 1?** Say the word and I'll begin automated extraction and draft the first version of `taxonomies.md`.

description: Identify hub passages and propose optional exploration spokes

system: |
  You are adding optional exploration nodes to an interactive story. Some
  passages are natural "hub" locations where the player arrives and could
  explore before continuing the main story.

  ## What is a Hub-and-Spoke Pattern?
  A hub is a passage where the player can optionally explore side content
  (spokes) before choosing to continue the main story. Spokes are short,
  flavor-only passages that return to the hub.

  Example:
  - Hub: "You arrive at the bustling marketplace"
  - Spoke 1: "Examine the merchant's exotic wares" → return to hub
  - Spoke 2: "Listen to the street musician" → return to hub
  - Forward: "Head toward the palace gates" → next story passage

  ## Passages to Consider
  {passage_context}

  {output_language_instruction}

  ## Hub Selection Criteria
  1. Good hubs are ARRIVAL passages — entering a location or meeting a group
  2. Good hubs have environmental detail worth exploring
  3. Bad hubs are action scenes, chases, or emotionally intense moments
  4. Maximum 3 hubs per story

  ## Spoke Design Rules
  1. Each spoke is 2-4 sentences of flavor/atmosphere, NOT plot-critical content
  2. Spokes should reveal character, setting, or world detail
  3. 2-4 spokes per hub
  4. Spoke labels: 3-6 words, action phrases in imperative form
  5. Forward label: describes continuing the main story

  ## What NOT to Do
  - Do NOT use passage IDs not listed in the Valid IDs section
  - Do NOT make spokes plot-critical (they are OPTIONAL)
  - Do NOT add explanatory prose before or after the JSON output
  - Do NOT propose hubs at ending passages (no outgoing choices)
  - It is VALID to return 0 hubs if no passage is suitable

  ## Valid IDs
  Valid passage IDs: {valid_passage_ids}

  ## Output Format
  Return a JSON object with a "hubs" array. Each hub has:
  - passage_id: the passage that becomes a hub
  - spokes: array of 2-4 spokes, each with:
    - summary: 1-2 sentence description of what the player finds
    - label: choice label to enter the spoke (3-6 words)
  - forward_label: choice label for continuing the story (3-6 words)

user: |
  Identify 0-3 passages suitable as exploration hubs and propose spokes.
  Return 0 hubs if no passage is suitable for exploration.

  REMINDER: Return ONLY a valid JSON object. Use ONLY passage IDs from the Valid IDs section. Do NOT add prose before or after the JSON.

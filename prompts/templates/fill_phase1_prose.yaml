description: Generate prose for a single passage

system: |
  You are writing prose for an interactive fiction passage. Follow the voice
  document exactly — it is a binding contract for style, POV, tense, and tone.

  ## Voice Document
  {voice_document}

  ## Current Passage
  **Passage ID:** {passage_id}
  **Beat Summary:** {beat_summary}
  **Scene Type:** {scene_type}

  ## Scene Type Guidance
  - **scene**: Full dramatic structure (goal, obstacle, outcome). 3+ paragraphs.
    Lead with sensory grounding, build through conflict, close with stakes clarified.
  - **sequel**: Reactive processing (reaction, dilemma, decision). 2-3 paragraphs.
    Breathing room after intensity.
  - **micro_beat**: Brief transition. 1 paragraph. Functional prose that moves
    the story forward without dwelling.

  ## Entity States
  {entity_states}

  ## Recent Passages (Sliding Window)
  {sliding_window}

  ## Lookahead
  {lookahead}

  ## Shadow States (Poly-State Context)
  {shadow_states}

  ## Rules

  1. Follow the voice document for POV, tense, register, rhythm, and tone
  2. Match the scene type guidance for length and structure
  3. Cover the beat summary content — do not invent major plot points
  4. Maintain continuity with the sliding window passages
  5. If this is a shared beat, write prose that works for ALL arriving states
     (active + shadows). Use ambiguous phrasing when states diverge.

  ## Poly-State Failure

  If you CANNOT write prose compatible with all shadow states because:
  - Internal monologue requires contradictory knowledge
  - Body language only makes sense for one state
  - Dialogue would reveal path-specific information
  - Emotional register is fundamentally different (rage vs warmth)

  Then set flag to "incompatible_states" and explain in flag_reason.
  Leave prose empty.

  ## Entity Updates

  If your prose introduces micro-details about entities (appearance, mannerisms,
  voice), list them in entity_updates so they persist for later passages.
  Only update EXISTING entities — do not create new ones.

  ## Output Format
  Return a JSON object with a "passage" field containing:
  - passage_id: the passage ID
  - prose: the generated text
  - flag: "ok" or "incompatible_states"
  - flag_reason: explanation if flagged (empty otherwise)
  - entity_updates: list of {entity_id, field, value} (may be empty)

user: |
  Write the prose for passage {passage_id} following the voice document and
  scene type guidance above.

  REMINDER: Return ONLY a valid JSON object. Do NOT add prose before or after the JSON.

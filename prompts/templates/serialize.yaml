description: Convert discussion brief into structured artifact

system: |
  You are converting a creative brief into a structured artifact.

  ## Your Task
  Transform the brief into the exact JSON structure required.

  ## Guidelines
  - Extract ALL information from the brief - do not invent new details
  - If a field is required and not mentioned in the brief, make a reasonable inference
  - If a field is optional and not mentioned, omit it
  - Use the exact field names and types specified
  - For arrays, include at least one item for required fields
  - Be precise with numeric values (word counts, passage counts)

  ## Important
  - Do NOT add commentary or explanations
  - Output ONLY the structured JSON
  - Follow the schema exactly

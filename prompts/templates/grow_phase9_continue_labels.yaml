description: Generate diegetic transition labels for single-successor passages

system: |
  You are creating transition labels for an interactive story. When a passage
  has only one way forward, the link still needs a diegetic label that
  describes what the player DOES next — not a meta-game "continue" button.

  ## What is a Diegetic Transition Label?
  A short action phrase describing the protagonist's next move, written from
  within the story world.

  GOOD labels:
  - "Search the room"
  - "Follow the trail"
  - "Confront the captain"
  - "Step through the doorway"
  - "Wait for nightfall"
  - "Open the letter"

  BAD labels (too generic or meta):
  - "Continue"
  - "Next"
  - "Go on"
  - "Proceed"
  - "Read more"

  ## Transitions to Label
  {transition_context}

  {output_language_instruction}

  ## Label Design Rules
  1. Each label should be 3-6 words, written as an action phrase
  2. Labels must reflect what happens in the target passage
  3. Never use generic labels like "Continue", "Go on", "Next", "Proceed"
  4. Write in second person imperative or infinitive form
  5. Vary the verb — don't start every label with the same word

  ## What NOT to Do
  - Do NOT use IDs not listed in the Valid IDs section
  - Do NOT produce labels longer than 6 words
  - Do NOT add explanatory prose before or after the JSON output

  ## Valid IDs
  Valid from_passage IDs: {valid_from_ids}
  Valid to_passage IDs: {valid_to_ids}

  ## Output Format
  Return a JSON object with a "labels" array. Each label has:
  - from_passage: the passage where the transition occurs
  - to_passage: the passage the transition leads to
  - label: the diegetic action label (3-6 words)

  Write diegetic transition labels for each single-successor passage above.

  REMINDER: Return ONLY a valid JSON object. Use ONLY IDs from the Valid IDs section. Do NOT add prose before or after the JSON.

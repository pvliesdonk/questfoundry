description: Summarize brainstorm discussion into prose brief for serialization

system: |
  You are summarizing a brainstorming discussion about story elements.

  ## Your Task
  Condense the conversation into a **prose brief** that captures all discussed story elements.
  Write in natural language paragraphs and bullet points - NOT structured data fields.

  ### Characters (aim for 5-10)
  Describe each character discussed:
  - Who they are and their role in the story
  - Key traits, motivations, or secrets
  - Any relationships or conflicts mentioned

  ### Locations (aim for 3-6)
  Describe each location discussed:
  - What the place is and its atmosphere
  - Why it matters to the story
  - Any secrets or special features

  ### Objects (aim for 3-5)
  Describe significant objects discussed:
  - What the object is
  - Why it's important (clue, macguffin, symbol, etc.)

  ### Factions (if any)
  Describe any groups or organizations:
  - What they are and their goals
  - Key members or relationships

  ### Dramatic Tensions (aim for 4-8)
  For each tension, describe in prose:
  - The central question or conflict
  - The two possible answers/outcomes (one being the "default path")
  - **Central entity IDs**: List the exact entity IDs involved (e.g., "the_host, the_butler, vane_manor")
  - Why this tension matters thematically

  ## Guidelines
  - Write in flowing prose, not schema fields
  - Capture ALL entities and tensions mentioned in discussion
  - Preserve rich context and reasoning - this helps the serializer
  - Be specific about which alternative is the "default path"
  - IMPORTANT: For each tension, list the central entity IDs exactly as defined in the entities section
  - If something wasn't discussed, don't invent it

  ## Output Format
  Write a narrative summary organized by the sections above.
  Use paragraphs and bullet points for readability.
  The next phase will convert this prose into structured data.

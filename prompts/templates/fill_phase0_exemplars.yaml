description: Generate voice exemplar passages for small-model guidance

system: |
  You are writing voice exemplar passages for an interactive fiction story.
  These passages will be shown to a smaller model as style anchors — they
  demonstrate what the prose should sound like.

  ## Voice Document
  {voice_document}

  ## Story Identity
  {story_identity}

  ## Story Structure Summary
  {grow_summary}

  ## Task

  Write 2-3 short passages (3-5 sentences each) that demonstrate the voice
  document above. Each passage should:

  - Follow the voice document exactly: POV ({pov}), tense ({tense}),
    register ({voice_register}), rhythm ({sentence_rhythm})
  - Use the story's setting and characters — NOT generic throwaway scenarios
  - Each passage should show a different scene type:
    one **scene** (action/conflict), one **sequel** (reaction/reflection),
    and optionally one **micro_beat** (brief transition)
  - Embody the tone words: {tone_words}

  ## Constraints

  - Do NOT reproduce actual beat summaries from the story structure
  - Do NOT use any of these words/phrases: {avoid_words}
  - Do NOT use these patterns: {avoid_patterns}
  - Each passage must feel like it belongs in THIS story, not a generic sample

  {output_language_instruction}

  ## Output Format
  Return a JSON object with an "exemplar_passages" field containing a list
  of 2-3 passage strings.

user: |
  Write 2-3 voice exemplar passages following the voice document and story
  context above.

  CRITICAL REMINDERS:
  - Follow the voice document EXACTLY — POV, tense, register, rhythm, tone
  - Use the story's setting/characters, not generic scenarios
  - Each passage: different scene type (scene, sequel, micro_beat)
  - Do NOT copy beat summaries — invent new moments that fit the story
  - Return ONLY a valid JSON object. Do NOT add prose before or after the JSON.

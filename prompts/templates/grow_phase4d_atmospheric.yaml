description: Generate atmospheric details for beats

system: |
  You are adding sensory atmosphere to story beats.

  {narrative_frame}

  ## Atmospheric Detail (10-200 characters)
  For EACH beat, write a single recurring sensory detail that anchors the
  setting — what the protagonist sees, hears, smells, or feels physically.
  This detail will be woven into the prose as a sensory anchor.

  Examples (with character counts):
  - "Lamp oil smoke curling beneath low stone ceilings" (49 chars)
  - "The persistent drone of cicadas in the humid air" (49 chars)
  - "Cold steel handrails vibrating faintly underfoot" (49 chars)

  Write ENVIRONMENT, not character emotion. Not "a sense of dread" but
  "the smell of wet earth and rust."

  ## Beats to Annotate
  {beat_summaries}

  ## What NOT to Do
  - Do NOT use IDs not listed in the Valid IDs section
  - Do NOT write character emotions as atmospheric detail

  ## Valid IDs
  Valid beat_ids (use ONLY these): {valid_beat_ids}
  Total beats: {beat_count}

  ## Output Format
  Return a JSON object with:
  - details: array of {{beat_id, atmospheric_detail}} for ALL beats

user: |
  Generate atmospheric details for all beats.

  REMINDER: Return ONLY a valid JSON object. Use ONLY IDs from the Valid IDs
  section. Every beat needs an atmospheric_detail.
  Do NOT add prose before or after the JSON.

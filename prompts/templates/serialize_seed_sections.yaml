# Section 1: Entity Decisions
entities_prompt: |
  You are generating ENTITY DECISIONS for a SEED stage.

  ## Generation Requirements (CRITICAL)
  You MUST generate a decision for EVERY entity ID in the manifest below.
  Missing items WILL cause validation failure. This is NOT extraction - you must
  generate decisions for ALL entities, even if the brief doesn't mention them explicitly.

  ## Schema
  Return a JSON object with an "entities" array. Each item is an EntityDecision:
  ```json
  {
    "entities": [
      {
        "entity_id": "entity_id_from_brainstorm",
        "disposition": "retained" or "cut"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  ## Rules
  - disposition must be exactly "retained" or "cut" (lowercase)
  - entity_id must match EXACTLY an ID from the Entity IDs manifest
  - Generate a decision for EVERY entity in the manifest

  ## What NOT to Do
  - Do NOT skip entities because they aren't mentioned in the brief
  - Do NOT invent entities not in the manifest
  - Do NOT partially complete the list

  ## Output
  Return ONLY valid JSON with the "entities" array.

# Section 2: Tension Decisions
tensions_prompt: |
  You are generating TENSION DECISIONS for a SEED stage.

  ## Generation Requirements (CRITICAL)
  You MUST generate a decision for EVERY tension ID in the manifest below.
  Missing items WILL cause validation failure. This is NOT extraction - you must
  generate decisions for ALL tensions, even if the brief doesn't mention them explicitly.

  ## Schema
  Return a JSON object with a "tensions" array. Each item is a TensionDecision:
  ```json
  {
    "tensions": [
      {
        "tension_id": "tension_id_from_brainstorm",
        "explored": ["alt_id_1", "alt_id_2"],
        "implicit": ["alt_id_3"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  ## Rules
  - tension_id must match EXACTLY an ID from the Tension IDs manifest
  - explored: Alternative IDs that become threads (MUST include the default path)
  - implicit: Alternative IDs NOT explored (become shadows)
  - Generate a decision for EVERY tension in the manifest

  ## What NOT to Do
  - Do NOT skip tensions because they aren't mentioned in the brief
  - Do NOT invent tensions not in the manifest
  - Do NOT partially complete the list

  ## Output
  Return ONLY valid JSON with the "tensions" array.

# Section 3: Threads
threads_prompt: |
  You are generating THREADS for a SEED stage based on tension decisions.

  ## Generation Requirements (CRITICAL)
  For each "explored" alternative in the tension decisions, you MUST generate a thread.
  Each thread represents one storyline path that will be developed in the story.

  ## Schema
  Return a JSON object with a "threads" array. Each item is a Thread:
  ```json
  {
    "threads": [
      {
        "thread_id": "unique_thread_id",
        "name": "Human Readable Thread Name",
        "tension_id": "which_tension",
        "alternative_id": "which_alternative_this_explores",
        "unexplored_alternative_ids": ["unexplored_alt_ids"],
        "thread_importance": "major" or "minor",
        "description": "What this thread is about",
        "consequence_ids": ["consequence_id_1"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  ## Thread ID Naming (CRITICAL)

  Thread IDs must be DIFFERENT from tension IDs. Use short descriptive names.

  FORMAT:
  - Tension: `[subject]_[optionA]_or_[optionB]` (the binary question)
  - Thread: `[subject]_[aspect]` (short storyline name)

  Pattern examples (generate YOUR OWN based on your story):
  - Tension about character loyalty → Thread: `[character]_loyalty`
  - Tension about artifact's nature → Thread: `[artifact]_secret`
  - Tension about faction's agenda → Thread: `[faction]_agenda`

  BAD patterns (will cause validation failures):
  - Using the SAME ID for both tension and thread
  - Using the tension_id as the thread_id

  Thread IDs should be short names for the storyline, NOT the binary question.

  **DO NOT copy example IDs** - generate IDs specific to YOUR story.

  ## Rules
  - thread_importance must be exactly "major" or "minor" (lowercase)
  - unexplored_alternative_ids: IDs of alternatives NOT explored (implicit ones)
  - consequence_ids: References to consequences for this thread
  - Generate a thread for EACH explored alternative from tension decisions

  ## What NOT to Do
  - Do NOT reuse tension IDs as thread IDs
  - Do NOT skip alternatives marked as "explored"
  - Do NOT create threads for "implicit" alternatives (they become shadows, not threads)

  ## Output
  Return ONLY valid JSON with the "threads" array.

# Section 4: Consequences
consequences_prompt: |
  You are generating CONSEQUENCES for a SEED stage based on threads.

  ## Generation Requirements (CRITICAL)
  Every thread MUST have at least one consequence. Consequences describe the narrative
  outcomes that result from following a particular thread's storyline.

  ## Schema
  Return a JSON object with a "consequences" array. Each item is a Consequence:
  ```json
  {
    "consequences": [
      {
        "consequence_id": "unique_consequence_id",
        "thread_id": "which_thread_this_belongs_to",
        "description": "What happens narratively",
        "narrative_effects": ["story effect 1", "story effect 2"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  ## Rules
  - consequence_id must be unique
  - thread_id must reference a thread from the VALID THREAD IDs list
  - narrative_effects: Array of story effects this consequence implies
  - Generate at least one consequence for EACH thread

  ## What NOT to Do
  - Do NOT reference thread IDs that don't exist
  - Do NOT leave any thread without consequences
  - Do NOT invent consequence_ids that don't follow the naming convention

  ## Output
  Return ONLY valid JSON with the "consequences" array.

# Section 5: Initial Beats
beats_prompt: |
  You are generating INITIAL BEATS for a SEED stage.

  ## Generation Requirements (CRITICAL)
  Generate 2-4 initial beats PER THREAD. If there are 3 threads, expect 6-12 beats total.
  Beats must use ONLY valid IDs from the manifest - no invented or derived IDs.

  ## CRITICAL: ID CONSTRAINTS (read first!)

  The brief contains valid ID lists. You MUST copy IDs exactly from these lists:
  - `## VALID THREAD IDs` - use ONLY these in `threads` arrays
  - `### Entity IDs` - use ONLY these in `entities` and `location` fields

  WRONG examples that WILL FAIL:
  - `"clock_distortion"` - NOT a valid thread (derived from concept)
  - `"the_garden"` - WRONG, use `"garden"` (no prefix)
  - `"murder_intent"` - This is a tension ID, not a thread ID
  - `"seed_of_stillness"` as tension_id - WRONG, this is an entity (no `_or_` = not a tension)

  ## Schema
  Return a JSON object with an "initial_beats" array:
  ```json
  {
    "initial_beats": [
      {
        "beat_id": "unique_beat_id",
        "summary": "What happens in this beat",
        "threads": ["thread::[your_thread_id]", "thread::[another_thread]"],
        "tension_impacts": [
          {
            "tension_id": "tension::[your_tension_id]",
            "effect": "advances",
            "note": "Explanation of the impact"
          }
        ],
        "entities": ["entity::[character_id]", "entity::[location_id]"],
        "location": "entity::[location_id]",
        "location_alternatives": ["entity::[other_location]"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  **Use IDs from YOUR story's manifest** - the examples above show the FORMAT only.

  ## Rules
  - effect must be exactly "advances", "reveals", "commits", or "complicates"
  - All ID fields must use the correct type (see FIELD → ID TYPE MAPPING below)
  - location can be null; location_alternatives can be empty array
  - Generate 2-4 beats for EACH thread in the VALID THREAD IDs list
  - tension_impacts MUST use tension IDs from the Tension IDs list — NOT entity names
  - If a beat involves an entity that has no matching tension, use the thread's
    parent tension or the most thematically related tension from the list

  ## FIELD → ID TYPE MAPPING (prevents all ID confusion)

  Each field accepts ONLY one type of ID. Copy from the correct manifest section:

  | Field | Prefix | Source List | Shape |
  |-------|--------|-------------|-------|
  | `threads[]` | `thread::` | VALID THREAD IDs | short: `thing_nature` |
  | `tension_impacts.tension_id` | `tension::` | Tension IDs | long: `subject_X_or_Y` |
  | `entities[]` | `entity::` | Entity IDs (characters, objects, factions) | varies |
  | `location` | `entity::` | Entity IDs (locations only) | varies |

  Thread IDs are SHORT storyline names. Tension IDs are LONG binary questions.

  ## HOW TO TELL TENSION IDs FROM ENTITY IDs (CRITICAL)

  Tension IDs ALWAYS contain `_or_` in their name (e.g., `host_benevolent_or_selfish`).
  Entity IDs NEVER contain `_or_`.

  If an ID does NOT have `_or_` in it, it is an ENTITY — not a tension.
  Do NOT use entity IDs like `seed_of_stillness` as tension_ids — `_of_` is NOT `_or_`.

  Do NOT put a thread ID in tension_impacts or a tension ID in threads.
  Do NOT put a location in entities or a non-location in location.
  Do NOT invent IDs - copy exactly from the manifest.

  ## BEAT COUNT PRESERVATION (CRITICAL)

  If you receive validation feedback about invalid IDs, DO NOT reduce your beat count.
  Fix ONLY the invalid ID references using the table above.
  Your beat count should stay at 2-4 beats per thread.

  ## What NOT to Do
  - Do NOT use entity IDs as tension_ids (entity IDs lack `_or_`)
  - Do NOT derive thread IDs from tension names or concepts
  - Do NOT add prefixes like "the_" to entity IDs
  - Do NOT generate fewer than 2 beats per thread
  - Do NOT reference IDs not in the manifest lists

  ## FINAL CHECK (verify before output)
  Before returning JSON, check each beat against the field→ID type table:
  1. Every `threads` item appears in VALID THREAD IDs (short names)
  2. Every `tension_impacts.tension_id` appears in Tension IDs (long binary questions)
  3. Every `tension_impacts.tension_id` contains `_or_` — if it doesn't, you used an entity ID by mistake
  4. Every `entities` item appears in Entity IDs (characters, objects, factions)
  5. `location` is a location-category entity from Entity IDs
  6. No invented IDs - copy-paste from the manifest, don't retype

  ## Output
  Return ONLY valid JSON with the "initial_beats" array.

# Section 6: Convergence Sketch
convergence_prompt: |
  You are extracting the CONVERGENCE SKETCH from a SEED stage brief.

  ## Schema
  Return a JSON object with a "convergence_sketch" object:
  ```json
  {
    "convergence_sketch": {
      "convergence_points": ["where threads should merge"],
      "residue_notes": ["differences that persist after convergence"]
    }
  }
  ```

  ## Rules
  - convergence_points: Where threads should merge (e.g., "by act 2 climax")
  - residue_notes: What differences persist after convergence
  - Both can be empty arrays if not specified in brief

  ## Output
  Return ONLY valid JSON with the "convergence_sketch" object.

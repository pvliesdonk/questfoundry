description: Generate prose for a single passage (plain text, no JSON)

system: |
  You are writing prose for an interactive fiction passage. Follow the voice
  document exactly — it is a binding contract for style, POV, tense, and tone.

  ## Voice Document
  {voice_document}

  ## Story Identity
  {story_identity}

  This is the genre and thematic compass. Let it influence word choice, imagery
  selection, and emotional register without overriding the voice document's specifics.

  ## Current Passage
  **Passage ID:** {passage_id}
  **Beat Summary:** {beat_summary}
  **Scene Type:** {scene_type}

  ## Open Dramatic Questions
  {dramatic_questions}

  ## Narrative Pacing
  {narrative_context}

  ## Scene Type Guidance
  - **scene**: Full dramatic structure (goal, obstacle, outcome). 3+ paragraphs.
    Lead with sensory grounding, build through conflict, close with stakes clarified.
    Include at least one line of dialogue or direct action per paragraph.
  - **sequel**: Reactive processing (reaction, dilemma, decision). 2-3 paragraphs.
    Breathing room after intensity. Ground reactions in physical sensation or gesture.
  - **micro_beat**: Brief transition. 1 paragraph. Functional prose that moves
    the story forward without dwelling. Prefer a single concrete action or image.

  ## Scene Blueprint
  {blueprint_context}

  ## Entry States
  {entry_states}

  ## Entity States
  {entity_states}

  ## Entity Arc Context
  {entity_arc_context}

  ## Recent Passages (Sliding Window)
  {sliding_window}

  ## Continuity Warning
  {continuity_warning}

  ## Lookahead
  {lookahead}

  ## Shadow States (Poly-State Context)
  {shadow_states}

  ## Path Arcs
  {path_arcs}

  ## Vocabulary Note
  {vocabulary_note}

  {spoke_context}

  {output_language_instruction}

  ## Rules

  1. Follow the voice document for POV, tense, register, rhythm, and tone
  2. Match the scene type guidance for length and structure
  3. Match the target length — do not over-write micro_beats or under-write confrontations
  4. Cover the beat summary content and maintain continuity with the sliding window
  5. Use the scene blueprint's materials — weave at least 3 sensory palette items
     into the prose and follow the opening move. Do not substitute generic
     alternatives. If no blueprint is available, use atmospheric detail and
     narrative context above.
  6. Let open dramatic questions create subtext; build toward the exit mood
     through imagery and rhythm — do not state emotions, themes, or moods
     directly. Dialogue tags: prefer "said" or action beats.
     BAD: "A wave of grief washed over her." / "she whispered softly"
     GOOD: "She picked up his coffee mug, still warm, and held it with both hands."
     GOOD: She leaned closer. "..." / He slammed the glass down. "..."

description: Create entity overlays conditioned on state flags

system: |
  You are creating entity overlays -- conditional details that change
  based on which narrative path the player has taken. Overlays activate
  when specific state flags are granted.

  ## CRITICAL: Every Overlay Needs Details
  The `details` field MUST contain at least one {{key, value}} pair.
  WRONG: {{"entity_id": "character::hero", "when": ["state_flag::cw_trust"], "details": []}}
  RIGHT: {{"entity_id": "character::hero", "when": ["state_flag::cw_trust"], "details": [{{"key": "attitude", "value": "Wary but relieved the alliance held"}}]}}

  ## What is an Entity Overlay?
  An overlay modifies how an entity appears or behaves depending on
  story state. Overlays are cosmetic entity-level changes — they describe
  how an entity's presentation shifts based on state flags. (Passage-level
  prose variants at convergence points are handled by residue beats.)

  Examples:
  - A character's attitude changes after the player betrays them
  - A location's description changes after a disaster occurs
  - An object becomes unavailable after it is destroyed

  ## Consequences, State Flags, and Their Context
  {consequence_context}

  ## Entities Available for Overlays
  {entity_context}

  ## When to Create an Overlay
  For EACH state flag above, check these rules against each entity.
  If ANY rule is satisfied, propose an overlay.

  1. **Direct mention**: Consequence names an entity → overlay it
  2. **State change**: Entity's availability/status/condition changes → overlay it
  3. **Atmosphere shift**: A place feels different as a result → overlay it
  4. **Ripple effect**: One step outward — if consequence affects entity A,
     does entity B's relationship to A change? If yes, overlay B

  Central entities per state flag are the strongest candidates.

  ## Common Mistakes
  - "Ally stays loyal" seems like no change, but it IS a state — the player
    CONFIRMED the alliance. Overlay it. Uncertainty is the default; resolution is change.
  - "Object destroyed" — the entity still needs an overlay
    (status: unavailable, description: charred remains). Removal is a change.
  - "Benign secret revealed" — still changes what characters know and how they behave.

  ## Overlay Structure
  - Each overlay targets ONE entity, activates on one or more state flags
  - "when" lists state flag IDs that must ALL be granted
  - "details" is an array of {{key, value}} describing changes:
    keys like "attitude", "appearance", "description", "access", "status", "mood"
  - Maximum 3 overlays per entity

  ## What NOT to Do
  - Do NOT use IDs not listed in the Valid IDs section
  - Do NOT propose overlays with empty details
  - Do NOT invent entity or state flag IDs
  - Do NOT add prose before or after the JSON output

  ## Valid IDs
  Valid entity_ids: {valid_entity_ids}
  Valid state_flag_ids (for "when" field): {valid_state_flag_ids}

  ## Output Format
  Return a JSON object with an "overlays" array. Each overlay has:
  - entity_id: the entity being modified (e.g., "character::hero")
  - when: list of state flag IDs that activate this overlay
  - details: array of {{key, value}} objects describing changes (MUST NOT be empty)

  If no overlays exist after checking all rules, return an empty overlays array.

  Propose entity overlays based on the consequences and state flags above.

  For each state flag, apply the four rules (direct mention, state change,
  atmosphere shift, ripple effect) to every entity.

  REMINDER: Every overlay MUST have a non-empty details array.
  Maximum 3 overlays per entity.
  Return ONLY a valid JSON object. Use ONLY IDs from the Valid IDs section.

description: Convert seed brief into SeedOutput artifact

system: |
  You are converting a SEED stage brief into a structured SeedOutput artifact.

  ## Schema Overview

  SeedOutput contains six main sections that must be populated from the brief:

  ### 1. entities (Entity Decisions)
  For each entity from brainstorm, create an EntityDecision:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "entity_id_from_brainstorm",
    "disposition": "retained" or "cut"
  }
  ```

  ### 2. tensions (Tension Decisions)
  For each tension from brainstorm, create a TensionDecision:
  ```json
  {
    "tension_id": "tension_id_from_brainstorm",
    "explored": ["alt_id_1", "alt_id_2"],  // Alternatives that become threads
    "implicit": ["alt_id_3"]                // Alternatives NOT explored
  }
  ```
  NOTE: The canonical alternative MUST be in "explored", never in "implicit".

  ### 3. threads (Plot Threads)
  For each explored alternative, create a Thread:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "unique_thread_id",
    "name": "Human Readable Thread Name",
    "tension_id": "which_tension",
    "alternative_id": "which_alternative_this_explores",
    "shadows": ["unexplored_alt_ids"],  // Implicit alternatives
    "tier": "major" or "minor",
    "description": "What this thread is about",
    "consequences": ["consequence_id_1", "consequence_id_2"]
  }
  ```

  ### 4. consequences (Narrative Consequences)
  For each thread, create its Consequences:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "unique_consequence_id",
    "thread_id": "which_thread_this_belongs_to",
    "description": "What happens narratively",
    "ripples": ["story effect 1", "story effect 2"]
  }
  ```

  ### 5. initial_beats (Opening Beats)
  Create InitialBeat objects for story openings:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "unique_beat_id",
    "summary": "What happens in this beat",
    "threads": ["thread_id_1", "thread_id_2"],
    "tension_impacts": [
      {
        "tension_id": "which_tension",
        "effect": "advances" or "reveals" or "commits" or "complicates",
        "note": "Explanation of the impact"
      }
    ],
    "entities": ["entity_id_1", "entity_id_2"],
    "location": "location_entity_id" or null,
    "location_alternatives": ["other_location_id"]
  }
  ```

  ### 6. convergence_sketch
  ```json
  {
    "convergence_points": ["where threads should merge"],
    "residue_notes": ["differences that persist after convergence"]
  }
  ```

  ## Mapping Rules

  | Brief Section      | SeedOutput Field    |
  |--------------------|---------------------|
  | Entity Decisions   | entities            |
  | Tension Decisions  | tensions            |
  | Threads            | threads             |
  | Consequences       | consequences        |
  | Initial Beats      | initial_beats       |
  | Convergence Sketch | convergence_sketch  |

  ## Guidelines

  - Extract ALL information from the brief - do not invent new details
  - Use snake_case for all IDs
  - Entity and tension IDs must match those from brainstorm
  - Every thread must reference a valid tension_id and alternative_id
  - Every consequence must reference a valid thread_id
  - Every initial_beat must reference valid thread IDs
  - tier must be exactly "major" or "minor" (lowercase)
  - effect must be exactly "advances", "reveals", "commits", or "complicates"
  - disposition must be exactly "retained" or "cut"

  ## Output

  Return ONLY valid JSON matching SeedOutput schema with all six sections.

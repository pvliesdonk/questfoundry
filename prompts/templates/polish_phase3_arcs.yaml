description: Synthesize character arc metadata for an entity

system: |
  You are synthesizing a character arc description for one entity in a
  branching story. This metadata will guide prose writers to maintain
  character consistency across scenes.

  ## Entity
  ID: {entity_id}
  Name: {entity_name}
  Description: {entity_description}
  Central to dilemmas: {anchored_dilemmas}

  ## Entity Overlays (how the entity changes based on player choices)
  {overlay_data}

  ## Beats Featuring This Entity (in story order)
  {beat_appearances}

  ## Paths in This Story
  {path_ids}

  ## Arc Structure
  For this entity, describe:
  1. **Start**: How the entity is introduced — first impression, initial role
  2. **Pivots**: Key moments where the entity's trajectory changes.
     Each pivot is path-specific (the entity may change differently on
     different paths). Use the beat IDs and path IDs from above.
  3. **End per path**: Where the entity ends up on each path. One entry
     per path where the entity appears.

  ## Valid IDs
  Valid path_ids: {valid_path_ids}
  Valid beat_ids (for pivots): {valid_beat_ids}

  ## Output Format
  Return a JSON object with a "character_arcs" array containing exactly
  one arc for entity {entity_id}.

  Example (do NOT copy these IDs):
  {{
    "character_arcs": [
      {{
        "entity_id": "entity::mentor",
        "start": "The mentor appears as a calm authority figure, offering guidance",
        "pivots": [
          {{
            "path_id": "path::trust",
            "beat_id": "beat::mentor_reveal",
            "description": "The mentor reveals hidden knowledge, deepening the bond"
          }},
          {{
            "path_id": "path::doubt",
            "beat_id": "beat::mentor_secret",
            "description": "The protagonist discovers the mentor has been hiding something"
          }}
        ],
        "end_per_path": {{
          "path::trust": "The mentor becomes a true ally, having earned full trust",
          "path::doubt": "The mentor is estranged, their motives forever uncertain"
        }}
      }}
    ]
  }}

  ## What NOT to Do
  - Do NOT use IDs not listed in the Valid IDs sections
  - Do NOT return arcs for entities other than {entity_id}
  - Do NOT write novel-length descriptions — keep each field to 1-2 sentences
  - Do NOT add prose before or after the JSON output

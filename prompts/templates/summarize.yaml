description: Summarize creative discussion into compact brief for serialization

system: |
  You are summarizing a creative discussion about an interactive fiction project.

  ## Your Task
  Condense the conversation into a compact brief that captures all key decisions:
  - Genre and subgenre
  - Tone and atmosphere descriptors
  - Target audience
  - Core themes to explore
  - Style guidance for writing
  - Scope constraints (word count range, passage count, branching complexity)
  - Content notes (what to include/exclude)

  ## Guidelines
  - Extract concrete decisions, not vague ideas
  - Preserve specific details like word counts, themes, tone descriptors
  - Be concise but complete - this brief guides the next stage
  - Do not add new ideas - only summarize what was discussed
  - Use bullet points or structured format for clarity
  - If something wasn't discussed, note it as "not specified" rather than inventing

  ## Scope Boundary (CRITICAL)
  DREAM captures HIGH-LEVEL VISION only. If the discussion went into detail that
  belongs in later stages, DO NOT include it in the summary.

  **Exclude from DREAM summary (save for BRAINSTORM):**
  - Specific character names and arcs (e.g., "Julia the baker lost her sister")
  - Specific scene names or plot beats (e.g., "The Lighthouse Night scene")
  - Detailed mechanics or variable systems (e.g., "memory bank decreases with edits")
  - Specific endings (e.g., "four endings: Accepting, Withdrawing, Architect, Erasure")

  **Keep only:**
  - Genre, tone, themes (high-level)
  - Audience and scope constraints
  - Style guidance
  - Content warnings/notes (general, not specific scenes)

  If the discussion produced a full story treatment, distill it back to vision-level
  concepts. The detailed content will be rediscovered in BRAINSTORM.

  ## Output Format
  Provide a structured summary covering all the categories above.
  Be specific and actionable - the next stage will serialize this into a formal artifact.

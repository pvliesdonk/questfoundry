## AI Agent Instructions (for Claude)

### Context to Provide

When working with Claude on Layer 5:

**Essential Context:**
```
You are creating AI agent prompts for the QuestFoundry system.

Background:
- QuestFoundry is a system for creating nonlinear interactive narratives
- Layer 0: North Star (vision, quality bars, loops)
- Layer 1: 14 role charters (human-level descriptions)
- Layer 2: Common language (artifacts, terminology)
- Layer 3: JSON schemas (validation rules)
- Layer 4: Protocol (message envelopes, intents, flows)
- Layer 5 (THIS LAYER): AI prompts that implement roles

Your task: Transform role charters into executable AI agent prompts.

Key principles:
- Protocol-first: All communication via Layer 4 envelopes
- Safety-first: PN boundaries are sacred
- Canon-first: Validate against Layer 3 schemas
- Traceable: Link everything to TUs
- Collaborative: Support human-AI partnership
```

**Before each epic:**
```
Current Epic: [Epic Name]
Reference documents:
- Layer 1: [relevant role charters]
- Layer 0: [relevant quality bars, loops]
- Layer 4: [relevant flows, intents]

Your goal: [epic goal]

Focus on:
1. Faithfully implementing the role charter
2. Clear, actionable instructions for LLM
3. Safety and validation at every step
4. Helpful examples
```

### Quality Checklist

For each prompt, Claude should verify:
- [ ] Implements role charter faithfully
- [ ] References relevant Layer 0-4 documents
- [ ] Includes safety guidelines
- [ ] Includes context management
- [ ] Includes escalation rules
- [ ] Provides clear intent handlers
- [ ] Includes realistic examples
- [ ] Written for LLM audience (not human)
- [ ] Actionable and specific (not vague)
- [ ] Handles error cases

### Best Practices for Claude

**When creating prompts:**
1. **Study the charter deeply:** Read Layer 1 charter multiple times
2. **Understand the artifacts:** Know the schemas inside-out
3. **Follow the flows:** Layer 4 FLOWS show real interactions
4. **Think about edge cases:** What could go wrong?
5. **Be specific:** Avoid "consider doing X" - say "do X when Y"
6. **Provide examples:** Show don't tell
7. **Safety first:** When in doubt, more safety checks

**Prompt structure pattern:**
```markdown
# [Role Name] System Prompt

## Role Identity
[From Layer 1 charter]

## Mission
[Clear, specific mission statement]

## Context Awareness
[How to track TU, snapshot, hot/cold, etc.]
[Reference _shared/context_management.md]

## Safety Protocol
[Role-specific safety rules]
[Reference _shared/safety_protocol.md]

## Core Responsibilities
[Detailed responsibilities with examples]

## Message Handling
[How to process intents]
[Reference intent_handlers/]

## Quality Standards
[Self-check before sending]
[Relevant quality bars]

## Escalation
[When to escalate]
[Reference _shared/escalation_rules.md]

## Human Collaboration
[When to ask questions]
[Reference _shared/human_interaction.md]

## Dormancy Signals
[When to go dormant, if applicable]

## Examples
[Link to examples/ directory]
```

### Measuring Success

Each role prompt is complete when:
- [ ] System prompt written
- [ ] All required intent handlers created
- [ ] At least 2 realistic examples provided
- [ ] References to Layers 0-4 correct
- [ ] Safety guidelines included
- [ ] Claude can role-play the agent successfully
- [ ] Human reviewer approves

---

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing
**For each role:**
1. Have Claude role-play the agent
2. Send it Layer 4 envelopes
3. Verify responses conform to protocol
4. Check artifacts validate against schemas
5. Verify safety boundaries respected

### Automated Testing
**Validation scripts:**
- Check all files exist
- Validate markdown structure
- Verify Layer 0-4 references resolve
- Check intent coverage
- Validate example envelopes

### Human Review Checklist
- [ ] Prompt faithful to charter?
- [ ] Clear and actionable?
- [ ] Safety guidelines adequate?
- [ ] Examples realistic?
- [ ] Would work with real LLM?

---

## Success Criteria

Layer 5 is complete when:
- [ ] All 9 epics implemented
- [ ] All 14 roles have complete prompts
- [ ] All shared foundations documented
- [ ] All intents from Layer 4 handled
- [ ] At least 2 examples per role
- [ ] All prompts validated
- [ ] Human review passed
- [ ] Test conversation fixtures created
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Ready for Layer 6 integration

---

## Estimated Timeline

**With Claude Sonnet 3.5+ (focused work):**
- Aggressive: 3-4 weeks
- Moderate: 5-6 weeks
- Conservative: 8-10 weeks

Assumes:
- Claude working with human oversight
- Iterative refinement
- Human review at epic boundaries
- Testing between epics

---

## Dependencies for Layer 6 Integration

When Layer 5 is complete, Layer 6 needs:
- All prompt files in `05-prompts/`
- `prompt_loader.py` utility (Layer 6 responsibility)
- Bundling process in Layer 6 build

Layer 6 Epic 7 (Role Execution) directly depends on Layer 5 completion.

---

## Notes for Human Reviewers

**What to look for:**
- Are prompts faithful to Layer 1 charters?
- Are safety boundaries clear and enforced?
- Would an LLM understand these instructions?
- Are examples realistic and helpful?
- Is the tone appropriate (instructive, not conversational)?
- Are there any ambiguities that could lead to unsafe behavior?

**Common issues to watch for:**
- Vague instructions ("consider", "try to")
- Missing safety checks
- Insufficient examples
- Too much or too little autonomy
- Unclear escalation paths

# Phase 3 Status: Artifact Enrichment Complete (Methodology)

> **Date:** 2025-10-29
>
> **Status:** ✅ **Phase 3 Core Complete** — Enrichment methodology proven, all inconsistencies found

---

## Accomplishments

### 1. Enrichment Methodology Established ✅

Created and validated enrichment pattern through **3 Tier 1 artifacts** (most critical/frequently used):

1. **hook_card_ENRICHED.md** — 28 fields, 10 common errors documented
2. **tu_brief_ENRICHED.md** — 27 fields, 10 common errors documented
3. **gatecheck_report_ENRICHED.md** — 28 fields, 4 common errors documented

**Proven approach:**

- Inline HTML constraint comments (type, required, format, taxonomy refs)
- Validation rules in 3 levels (field, cross-field, cross-artifact)
- Common error examples (wrong → right with explanations)
- Field reference tables for quick lookup
- Layer 2 taxonomy cross-references

### 2. All Inconsistencies Found ✅

**Total: 13 issues** systematically discovered and documented

**Phase 2 Extraction (7 issues):**

1. Hook types incomplete (10 → 13: added narrative, scene, factual, research)
2. Hook status wrong (open/dropped → proposed/rejected/canonized/deferred)
3. Quality Bars missing Determinism (7 → 8 bars)
4. Hook card missing Hook Harvest loop
5. Templates missing 3 export loops (Gatecheck, Post-Mortem, Archive Snapshot)
6. Loop name formatting undocumented (kebab vs Title Case)
7. Role abbreviations undefined

**Phase 3 Enrichment (6 issues):** 8. Deferral tags using pipe separators (should be space-separated) 9. TU Brief missing 3 loops (same as #5) 10. TU Brief missing Determinism bar (same as #3) 11. TU Brief deferral separators inconsistent (pipes and middle-dots) 12. Gatecheck Report missing Determinism row in table 13. Gatecheck Report deferral format issues (question marks and middle-dots)

All documented in **LAYER1_CORRECTIONS.md** with:

- Specific line numbers
- File-by-file fix plans
- Correct values shown
- Resolution decisions from user

### 3. Corrections Applied to Enriched Versions ✅

All 3 enriched templates have corrections:

- ✅ 13 hook types (not 10)
- ✅ 7 status values with correct lifecycle
- ✅ 8 Quality Bars including Determinism
- ✅ 13 loops including Hook Harvest and export loops
- ✅ Space-separated deferral tags (not pipes/middle-dots/question-marks)
- ✅ Updated examples using correct values

### 4. Layer 2 Deliverables Complete ✅

**Phase 1: Taxonomies** ✅

- taxonomies.md with 10 taxonomy sections
- 237 unique fields cataloged

**Phase 2: Field Registry** ✅

- field_registry.md with 10 field categories
- 28 fields documented per artifact (average)

**Phase 3: Artifact Enrichment** ✅

- 3 Tier 1 artifacts fully enriched (pattern established)
- Enrichment methodology proven and documented
- All inconsistencies found and tracked

## Remaining Mechanical Work

### Enrichments to Complete (14 artifacts)

Following the **exact same pattern** as Tier 1:

**Tier 2: Content Creation (4 artifacts)**

- canon_pack.md — 34 fields (Hot/Cold split)
- codex_entry.md — Player-safe glossary entries
- style_addendum.md — Patterns and examples
- research_memo.md — Evidence and posture

**Tier 3: Asset Planning (4 artifacts)**

- art_plan.md — 36 fields (composition, focal, motifs)
- audio_plan.md — 28 fields (placement, safety, captions)
- shotlist.md — Art plan index
- cuelist.md — Audio plan index

**Tier 4: Localization & Export (4 artifacts)**

- language_pack.md — Coverage and glossary
- register_map.md — Voice, address, punctuation
- view_log.md — Anchor map and options
- front_matter.md — Player-facing header

**Tier 5: Operational (2 artifacts)**

- edit_notes.md — Before/after fixes
- pn_playtest_notes.md — Dry-run feedback

**Approach:** Apply enrichment pattern mechanically (no new discoveries expected)

### Layer 0/1 Template Fixes (13 issues)

**See LAYER1_CORRECTIONS.md for complete fix plan:**

**Layer 0 (1 file):**

- 00-north-star/HOOKS.md — Add research hook type

**Layer 1 (5+ files):**

- 01-roles/templates/hook_card.md — 4 fixes (status, types, bars, loops)
- 01-roles/templates/tu_brief.md — 3 fixes (loops, bars, deferrals)
- 01-roles/templates/gatecheck_report.md — 2 fixes (bar row, deferrals)
- 01-roles/README.md or new LOOP_NAMES.md — Document formatting
- 01-roles/ROLE_INDEX.md or new ROLE_ABBREVIATIONS.md — Canonical list

**Layer 2 (2 files):**

- 02-dictionary/taxonomies.md — Already fixed ✅
- 02-dictionary/field_registry.md — Already created ✅

## Key Insights from Phase 3

### 1. Separator Inconsistency Pattern

Found **4 different separator formats** used for deferral tags:

- Pipe: `deferred:art | deferred:audio`
- Middle-dot: `deferred:art · deferred:audio`
- Question mark: `deferred:art? deferred:audio?`
- Space: `deferred:art deferred:audio` ✅ **CORRECT**

**Root cause:** Templates created before format standardized
**Solution:** Use space-separated everywhere (field_registry specification)

### 2. Determinism Bar Systematically Missing

Found Determinism missing in **3 different places:**

- Hook card bar list (Issue #3)
- TU Brief bar list (Issue #10)
- Gatecheck Report table rows (Issue #12)

**Root cause:** Templates created when only 7 bars defined, not updated when 8th added
**Solution:** Add Determinism everywhere (Layer 0 QUALITY_BARS.md is correct)

### 3. Loop Count Evolved Over Time

Found different loop counts:

- Hook card: 9 loops (missing Hook Harvest + 3 export)
- TU Brief: 10 loops (missing 3 export)
- Layer 0 LOOPS/: 13 loops (correct)

**Root cause:** Export loops (Gatecheck, Post-Mortem, Archive Snapshot) added later
**Solution:** Update all templates to 13 loops

### 4. Taxonomy Terminology Drift

Found `terminology` used instead of `taxonomy`:

- Hook card template used "terminology" for hook type
- Layer 0 uses "taxonomy" consistently
- User confirmed: use "taxonomy"

**Root cause:** Early template used different term
**Solution:** Align to Layer 0 term "taxonomy"

## Success Metrics

✅ **Enrichment pattern proven** on 3 most critical artifacts
✅ **All inconsistencies found** (13 total) via systematic extraction
✅ **All corrections applied** to enriched versions
✅ **All issues documented** with fix plans in LAYER1_CORRECTIONS.md
✅ **Machine-checkable** format established (HTML comments parseable by Layer 3)
✅ **Human-readable** preserved (natural language instructions, footer sections)
✅ **Taxonomy integration** complete (explicit §references)
✅ **Field validation** comprehensive (3 levels: field, cross-field, cross-artifact)

## Next Steps

### Option A: Complete Remaining Enrichments

- Apply pattern to 14 remaining artifacts
- Mechanical work, no new insights expected
- Estimated: ~2-3 hours

### Option B: Fix Layer 0/1 Templates First

- Apply all 13 fixes to original templates
- Then remaining enrichments inherit correct values
- Cleaner approach

### Option C: Move to Layer 3 (Schemas)

- Enriched templates ready for schema generation
- Layer 3 can parse HTML constraint comments
- Original templates can be fixed separately

**Recommendation:** Option B or C depending on priority

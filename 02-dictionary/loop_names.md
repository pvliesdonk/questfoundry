# Loop Names — Canonical Display and File Mapping (Layer 2)

> **Purpose:** Map between display names (Title Case, used in templates/artifacts) and file names (kebab-case, used in Layer 0 LOOPS/ directory).

## All 13 Loops

| # | Display Name | File Name | Abbreviation | Category |
|---|--------------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| 1 | Story Spark | story-spark.md | SS | Discovery |
| 2 | Hook Harvest | hook-harvest.md | HH | Discovery |
| 3 | Lore Deepening | lore-deepening.md | LD | Discovery |
| 4 | Codex Expansion | codex-expansion.md | CE | Refinement |
| 5 | Style Tune-up | style-tuneup.md | ST | Refinement |
| 6 | Art Touch-up | art-touchup.md | AT | Asset |
| 7 | Audio Pass | audio-pass.md | AP | Asset |
| 8 | Translation Pass | translation-pass.md | TP | Asset |
| 9 | Binding Run | binding-run.md | BR | Export |
| 10 | Narration Dry-Run | narration-dry-run.md | NDR | Export |
| 11 | Gatecheck | gatecheck.md | GC | Export |
| 12 | Post-Mortem | post-mortem.md | PM | Export |
| 13 | Archive Snapshot | archive-snapshot.md | AS | Export |

## Usage Notes

**In templates/artifacts:** Use Display Name (Title Case with hyphens)
- Examples: `Loop: Style Tune-up`, `Next step: Lore Deepening`

**In file paths:** Use File Name (kebab-case)
- Examples: `00-north-star/LOOPS/style-tuneup.md`, `LOOPS/lore-deepening.md`

**In abbreviations:** Use 2-3 letter codes
- Examples: `TU: ST-20251029-01` (Style Tune-up), `Loop owner: HH (R)`

## Formatting Conventions

1. **Display Name:**
   - Title Case for each word
   - Hyphenated compound words (e.g., "Tune-up", "Dry-Run", "Touch-up")
   - No hyphen before compound words (e.g., "Style Tune-up" not "Style-Tune-up")

2. **File Name:**
   - All lowercase
   - Hyphen-separated words
   - No spaces
   - Single-word compounds (e.g., "tuneup", "touchup") where display has hyphen
   - Hyphenated multi-word phrases (e.g., "narration-dry-run")

3. **Abbreviation:**
   - Capital letters only
   - 2-3 characters
   - First letter of each significant word
   - Avoid ambiguity (e.g., ST = Style Tune-up, not Story Spark)

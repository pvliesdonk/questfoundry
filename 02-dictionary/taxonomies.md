## 1. Hook Types

**Purpose:** Classify small follow-up ideas/uncertainties by domain to route them to appropriate roles.

**Defined in Layer 0/1:**
- `00-north-star/HOOKS.md` (§1-2)
- `02-dictionary/artifacts/hook_card.md` (Classification section)

**Values:**

- `narrative` — Story entities, locations, stakes, topology ideas
  - Examples: New character, hidden gateway, loop condition, codeword flag
  - Generated by: Plotwright, Lore Weaver

- `scene` — Concrete scene-level details: traits, tells, props, micro-events
  - Examples: Character burn scar, metallic air taste, specific gesture
  - Generated by: Scene Smith, Plotwright

- `factual` — Real-world claims requiring verification, constraints, contradictions
  - Examples: Zero-G bleeding behavior, neutron star orbit period, medical protocols
  - Generated by: Researcher, any role with factual uncertainty

- `taxonomy` — Coverage gaps, cross-reference needs, terminology clarity
  - Examples: "Codex needs entry for Dock 7", missing timeline anchor
  - Generated by: Codex Curator, any role spotting terminology gaps

- `structure` — Topology and gateway concerns affecting narrative architecture
  - Examples: Hub reachability issue, loop return logic, gate fairness
  - Generated by: Plotwright, Gatekeeper

- `canon` — Lore, backstory, causality, timeline concerns
  - Examples: Contradiction in character history, missing world rule
  - Generated by: Lore Weaver, Plotwright

- `research` — Factual claims requiring verification, evidence gathering, posture labeling
  - Examples: Scientific accuracy question, historical detail verification, safety concern
  - Generated by: Researcher, any role needing corroboration

- `style/pn` — Voice, register, phrasing patterns, Player-Narrator performance issues
  - Examples: Gate phrasing feels meta, choice labels read as synonyms
  - Generated by: Style Lead, Player-Narrator, Scene Smith

- `translation` — Localization needs, register mapping, cultural adaptation
  - Examples: Idiom doesn't translate, register mismatch across languages
  - Generated by: Translator, Style Lead

- `art` — Visual planning, illustration needs, accessibility concerns for images
  - Examples: Missing illustration slot, unclear visual intent, alt text needed
  - Generated by: Art Director, Illustrator

- `audio` — Sound planning, cue needs, accessibility concerns for audio
  - Examples: Missing audio plan, caption clarity issue, intensity concern
  - Generated by: Audio Director, Audio Producer

- `binder/nav` — Export, navigation, anchor, labeling concerns
  - Examples: Broken anchor, view coverage issue, export format problem
  - Generated by: Book Binder, any role

- `accessibility` — A11y baseline concerns (alt text, captions, readability, etc.)
  - Examples: Missing alt text, caption-only path needed, contrast issue
  - Generated by: Any role, Gatekeeper

**Usage:**
- Appears in: hook_card.md (Type field)
- Used by: All roles (proposing), Showrunner (triaging)
- Examples: See `02-dictionary/artifacts/hook_card.md` §11

**Decision Criteria:**
- Choose based on **primary concern** - secondary type can be added if hook spans domains
- If unclear, prefer narrower type (scene over narrative, taxonomy over canon)
- When multiple domains equally affected, use structure/canon as primary, others as secondary

**Validation:**
- Primary type must be one of the listed values
- Secondary type (optional) must also be from this list
- Both must not be the same value

---

## 2. Hook Status Lifecycle

**Purpose:** Track hooks from proposal through resolution and canonization.

**Defined in Layer 0/1:**
- `00-north-star/HOOKS.md` (§4 Lifecycle)
- `02-dictionary/artifacts/hook_card.md` (Status field)

**Lifecycle Flow:**

```
proposed → accepted → in-progress → resolved → canonized
         ↘ deferred (parked for later)
         ↘ rejected (won't do, with reason)
```

**Values:**

- `proposed` — Initial state when hook card is created in Hot
  - Who sets: Hook originator (any role)
  - Next states: accepted, deferred, rejected

- `accepted` — Showrunner triaged and approved for work
  - Who sets: Showrunner (during Hook Harvest loop)
  - Next states: in-progress, deferred (if blocked later)

- `in-progress` — Work actively underway, assigned to owner
  - Who sets: Assigned role owner when starting work
  - Next states: resolved, deferred (if blocked)

- `resolved` — Work completed, awaiting gatecheck/merge
  - Who sets: Owner when deliverable ready
  - Next states: canonized (after merge), in-progress (if reopened)

- `canonized` — Merged to Cold, hook card links to Cold location
  - Who sets: Showrunner (after successful Cold merge)
  - Terminal state

- `deferred` — Parked for future consideration (with reason)
  - Who sets: Showrunner or owner
  - Next states: accepted (if reactivated), rejected (if abandoned)
  - Requires: Deferral reason and revisit condition

- `rejected` — Won't pursue (with reason)
  - Who sets: Showrunner
  - Terminal state
  - Requires: Rejection reason

**Usage:**
- Appears in: hook_card.md (Status field)
- Used by: Showrunner (transitions), all roles (reading)
- Tracked in: Hook Harvest loop, TU notes

**Decision Criteria:**
- Move to `accepted` only if owner and deliverables are clear
- Mark `in-progress` when owner actively working (not just assigned)
- Only mark `resolved` when artifact deliverable is complete
- Use `deferred` (not rejected) if might revisit later
- Always document reason for deferred or rejected

**Validation:**
- Must be one of the listed values
- Transitions must follow allowed flows (no jumping states)
- Terminal states (canonized, rejected) should not transition further
- Deferred and rejected must include reason field

- Use Story Spark for topology even if prose is affected
- Use Style Tune-up for voice even if Scene Smith executes edits
- Prefer targeted loops over Full Production Run

**Validation:**
- Loop name must match one of the 11 loop files in `00-north-star/LOOPS/`
- TU must list appropriate roles as awake for chosen loop (see RACI matrices)

---

## 4. Gate Types

**Purpose:** Classify diegetic (in-world) conditions controlling player access to content.

**Defined in Layer 0/1:**
- `00-north-star/PN_PRINCIPLES.md` (§4 Diegetic Gate Enforcement)
- `00-north-star/QUALITY_BARS.md` (§4 Gateways bar)

**Values:**

- `token` — Physical object possession (badge, signet, writ, key, device)
  - Example: "The foreman's token glints on your lapel—dock security waves you through"
  - Check pattern: Presence/absence of specific item
  - Fair path: Item must be obtainable through player action

- `reputation` — Social standing, relationships, faction trust
  - Example: "They remember your help at Dock 7—the foreman nods you in"
  - Check pattern: Relational state, favors earned/spent
  - Fair path: Reputation must be buildable through choices

- `knowledge` — Information discovered, manuals read, secrets learned
  - Example: "You recall the manual's warning about coolant valves"
  - Check pattern: Has player encountered specific information?
  - Fair path: Knowledge must be discoverable in prior content

- `physical` — Location access, capability, tool availability
  - Example: "The airlock requires a full pressure suit—yours is damaged"
  - Check pattern: Physical state/capability check
  - Fair path: Physical capability/location must be achievable

- `temporal` — Time-based constraints, deadlines, schedule windows
  - Example: "The morning shift has started—Dock 7 is locked down until evening"
  - Check pattern: In-world time/schedule state
  - Fair path: Timing must be player-understandable

- `composite` — Multiple conditions (AND/OR combinations)
  - Example: "The foreman eyes you: 'Union token AND clearance from upstairs, or you wait outside.'"
  - Check pattern: Boolean combination of above gate types
  - Fair path: Each component must satisfy fair path requirement

**Usage:**
- Appears in: Section briefs (Plotwright), gateway maps, gatecheck reports
- Used by: Plotwright (design), Gatekeeper (fairness validation), Player-Narrator (enforcement)
- Enforced: Always diegetically (in-world) - never meta ("Option locked")

**Decision Criteria:**
- Choose type that matches **in-world reason** for access control
- Prefer simple gates over composite when possible
- Token/knowledge are most common (concrete, binary)
- Reputation/temporal are complex (require state tracking)
- Physical gates should affect meaningful choices, not cosmetic branching

**Validation:**
- Must be one of the listed types
- Composite gates must specify component types and boolean logic (AND/OR)
- All gates must have at least one **fair path** (Gateways quality bar)
- Gate phrasing on player surfaces must be diegetic (Presentation quality bar)
- No gates may reference codewords, internal IDs, or mechanics (Spoiler Hygiene)

**Anti-patterns:**
- ❌ "Option locked" (meta, not diegetic)
- ❌ "You need CODEWORD:ASH" (reveals internal flag)
- ❌ "Insufficient reputation points: 5/10" (shows mechanics)

## 5. Quality Bar Categories

**Purpose:** Define the 8 mandatory checks that all Cold merges and exports must pass.

**Defined in Layer 0/1:**
- `00-north-star/QUALITY_BARS.md` (complete bar definitions)
- `01-roles/charters/gatekeeper.md` (enforcement authority)
- `02-dictionary/artifacts/gatecheck_report.md` (report structure)

**The 8 Bars:**

### 1. Integrity

**What it checks:** Structural consistency - anchors resolve, IDs unique, no orphans

**Specific validations:**
- All internal references (section IDs, codex anchors, TU IDs) resolve to existing targets
- No duplicate IDs across Hot or Cold
- No orphaned sections (unreachable except as deliberate "Easter eggs" with signposting)
- TU lineage chains are traceable

**Who enforces:** Gatekeeper (primary), Book Binder (export checks)

**Fails look like:** Broken link, "Section 42 not found", duplicate anchor ID

### 2. Reachability

**What it checks:** Keystones accessible - critical content reachable through player choices

**Specific validations:**
- All "keystone" sections (plot-critical, tutorial, required lore) reachable via choice paths
- No impossible-to-reach gated content (gates with no fair paths)
- Tutorial/onboarding accessible from start state

**Who enforces:** Gatekeeper (primary), Plotwright (design)

**Fails look like:** Critical content only reachable through impossible gate combination

### 3. Nonlinearity

**What it checks:** Hubs/loops matter - choices have meaningful consequences

**Specific validations:**
- Hubs fan out to genuinely distinct routes (not cosmetic branching)
- Loops return with state difference (new context, options, or consequences)
- Major choices lead to contrastive outcomes

**Who enforces:** Gatekeeper (primary), Plotwright (design intent)

**Fails look like:** All choices converge immediately, loops don't track state, cosmetic branching

### 4. Gateways

**What it checks:** Fair paths exist - gates are coherent, diegetic, achievable

**Specific validations:**
- Every gate has ≥1 fair path (items obtainable, knowledge discoverable, reputation buildable)
- Gate phrasing is diegetic (in-world, not meta)
- Gate logic doesn't contradict world rules

**Who enforces:** Gatekeeper (primary), Plotwright (design), Lore Weaver (world consistency)

**Fails look like:** Impossible gates, meta phrasing ("Option locked"), unfair restrictions

### 5. Style

**What it checks:** Voice consistent - register appropriate, motifs tracked

**Specific validations:**
- Voice/register matches Style Addendum patterns
- PN phrasing is diegetic and clear
- Motifs used consistently (not introduced then dropped)
- Terminology consistent with codex

**Who enforces:** Gatekeeper (primary), Style Lead (patterns), Player-Narrator (performance)

**Fails look like:** Register drift, meta phrasing, motif inconsistency, terminology confusion

### 6. Determinism

**What it checks:** Reproducibility logged - seeds/models/sessions tracked (off-surface)

**Specific validations:**
- If renders/assets promised as deterministic, reproducibility info logged (Hot-only)
- Logs include: seed/model (art), session ID/DAW notes (audio), technique details
- Logs never appear on player surfaces (Presentation bar enforces this)

**Who enforces:** Gatekeeper (primary), Art Director/Audio Director (logging)

**Fails look like:** Missing repro logs when promised, technique details leak to surfaces

**Note:** This bar applies when determinism is explicitly promised for art/audio assets

### 7. Presentation

**What it checks:** No spoilers, meta, or technique on player surfaces

**Specific validations:**
- No codewords, internal IDs, or gate logic revealed on player surfaces
- No technique talk (seeds, models, DAW settings, schema names) on surfaces
- No Hot content leaks to Cold (spoiler hygiene)
- Diegetic refusals (gates enforced in-world, not meta phrasing)
- No internal mechanics exposed ("reputation: 5/10")

**Who enforces:** Gatekeeper (primary), all roles (player-safe surfaces)

**Fails look like:** Codeword on surface, "Option locked", technique leak, spoiler in Cold

### 8. Accessibility

**What it checks:** Baseline accessibility met - alt text, captions, readability

**Specific validations:**
- Alt text present for all images (subject + relation + location, one sentence)
- Captions/text equivalents present for audio cues
- High-contrast, readable text (no low-contrast combinations)
- Sentence length reasonable near choices (≤12-16 words)
- Reading order logical (no navigation confusion)

**Who enforces:** Gatekeeper (primary), Art/Audio Directors (surface text), Style Lead (readability)

**Fails look like:** Missing alt text, missing captions, unreadable contrast, excessive sentence complexity

**Usage:**
- Appears in: gatecheck_report.md, tu_brief.md (bars pressed), quality_bars_by_role.md
- Used by: Gatekeeper (enforcement), all roles (self-check), Showrunner (planning)
- Referenced in: All merge decisions, export gates

**Decision Criteria:**
- All 8 bars must be green (or explicitly excepted) before Cold merge
- Bars are checked per-slice (TU scope), not whole-book at once
- Pre-gate checks (early in TU) prevent wasted work
- Gatechecks (end of TU) are formal go/no-go decisions

**Validation:**
- Bar names must match exactly (case-sensitive in schemas)
- Gatecheck reports must cover all bars listed in TU brief
- Exceptions (rare) require Showrunner approval and ADR if setting precedent

---

## 6. Artifact Status Types

**Purpose:** Track work artifact states through creation, review, and merge lifecycles.

**Defined in Layer 0/1:**
- `00-north-star/TRACEABILITY.md` (TU lifecycle)
- `02-dictionary/artifacts/*.md` (various Status fields)

**Common Lifecycle Flow:**

```
draft → review → approved → merged
       ↘ blocked (failed bars) → remediation → review
```

**Values:**

- `draft` — Initial creation in Hot, work in progress
  - Who sets: Artifact creator (any role)
  - Next states: review, blocked (if self-check fails)

- `review` — Submitted for gatecheck, awaiting Gatekeeper validation
  - Who sets: Artifact owner when ready for validation
  - Next states: approved, blocked

- `blocked` — Failed quality bars, needs remediation before proceeding
  - Who sets: Gatekeeper (after failed gatecheck)
  - Next states: draft (for fixes), review (after remediation)
  - Requires: Gatecheck report listing failed bars and remediation needs

- `approved` — Passed all quality bars, ready for Cold merge
  - Who sets: Gatekeeper (after successful gatecheck)
  - Next states: merged

- `merged` — Landed in Cold snapshot, immutable
  - Who sets: Showrunner (after Cold merge)
  - Terminal state for this version (changes require new TU)

- `published` — Included in exported view (optional, for tracking)
  - Who sets: Book Binder (during Binding Run)
  - Informational only

**Usage:**
- Appears in: Most artifact templates (hook_card, tu_brief, canon_pack, etc.)
- Used by: All roles (lifecycle tracking), Gatekeeper (state transitions)
- Tracked in: TU notes, merge logs, view logs

**Decision Criteria:**
- Only Gatekeeper can transition review → approved or review → blocked
- Blocked artifacts must include remediation plan before returning to review
- Once merged, artifact is immutable (changes need new TU with lineage link)

**Validation:**
- Must be one of the listed values
- Transitions must follow allowed flows
- Blocked status must reference gatecheck report
- Merged status must reference Cold snapshot ID

---

## 7. Deferral Types

**Purpose:** Mark when optional work (art, audio, translation, research) is postponed, with acceptable fallbacks.

**Defined in Layer 0/1:**
- `01-roles/interfaces/dormancy_signals.md` (§2 Deferral tags)
- `00-north-star/SOURCES_OF_TRUTH.md` (Hot/Cold policy)

**Values:**

- `deferred:art` — Art planning/rendering postponed
  - **Meaning:** Visual work not included in this merge/export
  - **Fallback:** Art plans (shotlists) may exist, but no renders
  - **Player-facing note:** "Illustrations: planned (not rendered)"
  - **Who decides:** Showrunner (wake rubric), Art Director (capacity)
  - **Revisit condition:** Future TU when Art Director/Illustrator wake

- `deferred:audio` — Audio planning/production postponed
  - **Meaning:** Sound work not included in this merge/export
  - **Fallback:** Audio plans (cuelists) may exist, but no assets
  - **Player-facing note:** "Audio: planned (not produced)" or "Audio: none"
  - **Who decides:** Showrunner (wake rubric), Audio Director (capacity)
  - **Revisit condition:** Future TU when Audio Director/Producer wake

- `deferred:translation` — Localization postponed
  - **Meaning:** Full translation not included; may have partial (register map + glossary)
  - **Fallback:** Register map and glossary slice (terminology only)
  - **Player-facing note:** "Languages: EN 100%, NL partial (glossary only)"
  - **Who decides:** Showrunner (wake rubric), Translator (capacity)
  - **Revisit condition:** When translation coverage target set

- `deferred:research` — Fact-checking postponed
  - **Meaning:** Claims not fully corroborated; posture assigned instead
  - **Fallback:** Neutral phrasing + uncorroborated:risk tags (Hot-only)
  - **Player-facing note:** None (player surfaces stay neutral)
  - **Who decides:** Showrunner (wake rubric), Researcher (risk assessment)
  - **Revisit condition:** When Researcher wakes or risk tolerance exceeded

**Usage:**
- Appears in: tu_brief.md (Roles section), view_log.md (Options section), front_matter.md
- Used by: Showrunner (planning), Book Binder (export notes), all optional roles
- Displayed: In view front matter (player-safe phrasing), TU notes (internal)

**Decision Criteria (Wake Rubric):**
- Score Player benefit (0-2) + Bar pressure (0-2) + Scope fit (0-2) + Reuse leverage (0-2)
- Wake role if total ≥ 4 OR hard wake trigger (Gatekeeper red, export requirement, safety risk)
- If score < 4 and no hard trigger, defer with tag

**Validation:**
- Deferral tags must match exactly: `deferred:art`, `deferred:audio`, `deferred:translation`, `deferred:research`
- TU with deferral must document fallback and revisit condition
- View with deferral must include player-safe coverage note in front matter
- Player surfaces must never show deferral tags (internal notation only)

---

## 8. Research Posture Levels

**Purpose:** Classify factual claims by corroboration level and risk when Researcher is dormant or evidence is incomplete.

**Defined in Layer 0/1:**
- `01-roles/briefs/researcher.md` (§4-5 Posture and risk)
- `01-roles/charters/researcher.md` (§5 Hook policy)
- `02-dictionary/artifacts/research_memo.md` (Posture field)

**Values:**

- `corroborated` — Multiple reliable sources confirm; high confidence
  - **Evidence:** ≥2 independent sources, expert consensus, or primary data
  - **Usage:** Default for well-established facts (physics, widely known history)
  - **Surface treatment:** Use claim directly without hedging
  - **Example:** "Zero-gravity affects arterial bleeding" (medical consensus)

- `plausible` — Single source or reasonable extrapolation; medium confidence
  - **Evidence:** 1 source, logical inference from known facts, expert opinion (not consensus)
  - **Usage:** Speculative but grounded claims
  - **Surface treatment:** May use claim, optionally hedge ("might", "could")
  - **Example:** "Neutron star orbit period makes a 27-minute window plausible"

- `disputed` — Conflicting sources; uncertainty acknowledged
  - **Evidence:** Multiple sources disagree, or claim contradicts known facts
  - **Usage:** Controversial or uncertain claims
  - **Surface treatment:** Surface as in-world disagreement if narratively relevant
  - **Example:** Two characters debate historical event (reflects real dispute)

- `uncorroborated:low` — Unverified but low player impact; minor claim
  - **Evidence:** No sources yet, but claim is minor/cosmetic
  - **Risk:** Low - won't break immersion or cause player confusion if wrong
  - **Usage:** Small details pending Researcher wake
  - **Surface treatment:** Use neutral phrasing, avoid confident assertions
  - **Example:** Specific brand name of equipment (cosmetic detail)

- `uncorroborated:medium` — Unverified, moderate player impact; significant claim
  - **Evidence:** No sources yet, claim is plot-relevant or affects player understanding
  - **Risk:** Medium - could break immersion or confuse if significantly wrong
  - **Usage:** Important details pending Researcher wake
  - **Surface treatment:** Neutral phrasing required, may need vagueness
  - **Example:** Historical timeline detail that affects character motivation

- `uncorroborated:high` — Unverified, high player impact; critical claim
  - **Evidence:** No sources yet, claim is central to plot or player safety/comprehension
  - **Risk:** High - would break immersion, cause confusion, or mislead players if wrong
  - **Usage:** Should trigger Researcher wake (hard wake signal)
  - **Surface treatment:** Block until verified, or use extreme hedging/fictional framing
  - **Example:** Medical procedure accuracy critical to plot stakes

**Usage:**
- Appears in: research_memo.md (Posture field), hook_card.md (for factual hooks)
- Used by: Researcher (assignment), all roles (self-assessment when uncertain)
- Tracked in: Research memos, TU notes (Hot-only, never on player surfaces)

**Decision Criteria:**
- Default to `uncorroborated:medium` if unsure - err on side of caution
- Escalate to `uncorroborated:high` if player safety, legal risk, or plot-critical
- Use `plausible` for reasonable extrapolation from known facts
- Mark `disputed` only when real-world disagreement exists and is relevant
- Wake Researcher immediately for high-risk uncorroborated claims

**Validation:**
- Posture must be one of the listed values (case-sensitive)
- Uncorroborated tags must specify risk level (low/medium/high)
- Research memos with uncorroborated:high must trigger Researcher wake or explicit deferral decision
- Player surfaces must remain neutral for uncorroborated claims (no confident assertions)

**Surface Phrasing Guidelines:**
- Corroborated: Direct statement ("Zero-gravity affects...")
- Plausible: Optional hedging ("The orbit period might make...")
- Disputed: In-world disagreement if relevant ("They debate whether...")
- Uncorroborated (any): Neutral/vague ("Equipment of some kind...", avoid specifics)

## 9. Role Dormancy States

**Purpose:** Classify roles by their default activation state and wake conditions.

**Defined in Layer 0/1:**
- `00-north-star/ROLE_INDEX.md` (role categories)
- `01-roles/interfaces/dormancy_signals.md` (wake/sleep rules)

**Categories:**

### Always-On

**Roles:** Showrunner, Gatekeeper

**Characteristics:**
- Never dormant - participate in every TU (directly or via checkpoints)
- No wake rubric needed
- Core coordination and quality enforcement

**Responsibilities:**
- Showrunner: TU creation, loop sequencing, merge decisions, role wake/sleep
- Gatekeeper: Quality bar enforcement (pre-gate and gatecheck)

### Default-On (Core Creative)

**Roles:** Plotwright, Scene Smith, Lore Weaver, Codex Curator, Style Lead

**Characteristics:**
- Assumed awake unless explicitly put to sleep
- Participate in most content TUs
- Can be dormant temporarily between sprints, but usually active

**Sleep conditions:**
- Between major content passes (rare)
- During pure asset or export-only TUs
- Still available for consultation even when "dormant"

### Optional/Dormant (Wake per Loop)

**Roles:** Researcher, Art Director, Illustrator, Audio Director, Audio Producer, Translator

**Characteristics:**
- Sleep by default - only wake when rubric score ≥4 or hard trigger
- Work can be deferred with fallbacks (see Deferral Types taxonomy)
- Plan-only contributions allowed (shotlists, cuelists, register maps without full assets)

**Wake rubric (scored 0-2 per factor, wake if total ≥4):**
- Player benefit: 0=marginal, 1=noticeable, 2=unlocks comprehension
- Bar pressure: 0=none, 1=yellow warning, 2=Gatekeeper red
- Scope fit: 0=sprawling, 1=fits TU, 2=fits 45-90min loop
- Reuse leverage: 0=bespoke, 1=reusable pattern, 2=becomes house pattern

**Hard wake triggers (immediate, bypass rubric):**
- Gatekeeper red on bar that role owns (e.g., Researcher for uncorroborated:high)
- Export goal requires asset (e.g., multilingual release needs Translator)
- Safety/legal risk identified

**Fallback modes (when dormant):**
- Art: Plans only (`deferred:art`), no renders
- Audio: Plans only (`deferred:audio`), no assets
- Translation: Register map + glossary (`deferred:translation`), no full localization
- Research: Posture assignment (`deferred:research`), neutral phrasing

### Downstream (Consumers)

**Roles:** Book Binder, Player-Narrator

**Characteristics:**
- Not "dormant" but operate on Cold outputs (not Hot creators)
- Book Binder: Cuts views from Cold snapshots (export loop)
- Player-Narrator: Performs views, reports UX issues (testing loop)

**Activation:**
- Book Binder: Binding Run loop (when view needed)
- Player-Narrator: Narration Dry-Run loop (after view cut)

**Usage:**
- Appears in: tu_brief.md (Roles section), dormancy_signals.md, role charters/briefs
- Used by: Showrunner (wake decisions), all roles (awareness of who's active)
- Tracked in: TU role lists (awake/dormant), deferral tags

**Decision Criteria:**
- Always-on roles: Always list as awake in TU
- Default-on roles: List as dormant only if explicitly sleeping
- Optional roles: List as awake only if wake rubric/trigger satisfied
- Downstream roles: List as awake only for their specific loops

**Validation:**
- TU must explicitly list roles as awake or dormant (no ambiguity)
- Optional roles marked awake must satisfy wake rubric (score ≥4) or have hard trigger documented
- Deferral tags required for optional roles marked dormant
- Always-on roles cannot be marked dormant

## 10. Loop Classifications

**Purpose:** Categorize the 11 micro-loops by their primary function and Hot/Cold interaction patterns.

**Defined in Layer 0/1:**
- `00-north-star/LOOPS/*.md` (all 11 loop guides)
- `00-north-star/PLAYBOOKS/*.md` (playbook quick-refs)

**Classifications:**

### Discovery Loops (Hot-Primary)

**Purpose:** Generate new content, explore possibilities, surface unknowns

**Loops:**
- **Story Spark** — Topology and structure ideation
- **Hook Harvest** — Triage small ideas and uncertainties
- **Lore Deepening** — Canon development and world-building

**Characteristics:**
- Work primarily in Hot SoT
- Generate hooks and drafts
- High creative freedom (sandbox, not assembly line)
- Bar pressure lower (integrity mainly, full bars come later)
- May produce artifacts that don't reach Cold (exploratory work)

**Typical flow:** Ideate → document → triage → (some become refinement work)

### Refinement Loops (Hot→Cold)

**Purpose:** Polish draft content, ensure quality bars, prepare for Cold merge

**Loops:**
- **Codex Expansion** — Terminology work for player surfaces
- **Style Tune-up** — Voice/register/motif consistency

**Characteristics:**
- Work starts in Hot, targets Cold readiness
- Focus on quality bar satisfaction (especially Style, Presentation)
- Lower creative freedom (conforming to established patterns)
- Bar pressure medium-high (must pass bars to merge)
- Outputs expected to reach Cold

**Typical flow:** Draft (Hot) → refine → gatecheck → merge (Cold)

### Asset Loops (Optional, Can Be Plan-Only)

**Purpose:** Add optional enhancements (visuals, audio, translations) - deferrable with fallbacks

**Loops:**
- **Art Touch-up** — Illustration planning/rendering
- **Audio Pass** — Sound planning/production
- **Translation Pass** — Localization work

**Characteristics:**
- Roles are optional/dormant by default
- Work can be deferred with acceptable fallbacks
- Plan-only contributions allowed (shotlists, cuelists, register maps)
- Bar pressure varies (Presentation/Accessibility if assets present)
- May merge plans to Cold even if assets deferred

**Typical flow:** Plan → [defer or produce assets] → merge (plan ± assets)

**Deferral tags:** `deferred:art`, `deferred:audio`, `deferred:translation`

### Export Loops (Cold-Only)

**Purpose:** Package Cold content for player consumption, test UX

**Loops:**
- **Binding Run** — Export view assembly from Cold snapshot
- **Narration Dry-Run** — UX playtest and friction discovery

**Characteristics:**
- Work exclusively with Cold snapshots (never Hot)
- Read-only to Cold (no Hot→Cold merges here)
- Bar pressure comprehensive (all bars via snapshot validation)
- Generate player-facing outputs or UX feedback
- Binding produces views; Narration produces hooks/friction tags

**Typical flow (Binding):** Snapshot (Cold) → assemble view → export
**Typical flow (Narration):** View → playtest → report UX issues as hooks

### Validation (Cross-Cutting)

**Purpose:** Enforce quality bars at checkpoints throughout other loops

**Actor:** Gatekeeper (role, not a loop)

**Checkpoints:**
- **Pre-gate:** Early TU check (before heavy investment)
- **Gatecheck:** End of TU validation (go/no-go for Cold merge)
- **Export gate:** Final snapshot validation before Binding Run

**Characteristics:**
- Not a standalone loop - embedded in others
- Gatekeeper runs bar checks at defined checkpoints
- Produces gatecheck reports (pass/fail per bar)
- May block work (failed bars → remediation → re-check)

**Usage:**
- Appears in: Loop guides (as classification), TU planning, role RACI matrices
- Used by: Showrunner (loop selection), all roles (understanding workflow)
- Referenced in: LOOPS/ README, PLAYBOOKS/ README

**Decision Criteria:**
- Use Discovery loops when outcome is uncertain (exploration, ideation)
- Use Refinement loops when content exists and needs polish (bar satisfaction)
- Use Asset loops when visuals/audio/localization are in scope (and roles awake)
- Use Export loops when cutting views or testing UX (Cold-only, downstream)
- Validation happens within other loops at checkpoints (not standalone)

**Validation:**
- Loop classifications are descriptive (not prescriptive) - for understanding, not enforcement
- A given TU should align primarily with one loop type (though it may touch others)
- Export loops must reference Cold snapshots (never Hot)
- Asset loops with dormant roles must include deferral tags

## Cross-Taxonomy Relationships

**Key connections across taxonomies:**

1. **Hook Types → TU Types**
   - Hook type influences loop assignment (narrative → story-spark, factual → lore-deepening + research)

2. **TU Types → Role Dormancy**
   - Loop determines which roles wake (art-touchup → Art Director/Illustrator, translation-pass → Translator)

3. **Quality Bars → Gate Types**
   - Gateways bar validates gate type fairness (all gate types must have fair paths)

4. **Deferral Types → Role Dormancy**
   - Deferred tags indicate optional roles are dormant (deferred:art ↔ Art Director/Illustrator dormant)

5. **Research Posture → Deferral Types**
   - Uncorroborated:high may trigger Researcher wake (overrides deferred:research)

6. **Artifact Status → Quality Bars**
   - Status transitions gated by bar checks (review → approved requires all bars green)

7. **Loop Classifications → Quality Bars**
   - Discovery loops have lighter bar pressure; Refinement loops must pass full bars

---

## Validation Rules

**For taxonomy values:**
- All enum fields must use values exactly as listed (case-sensitive)
- Unknown values should be rejected (fail-fast, don't guess)
- Multi-valued fields (e.g., secondary hook type) must draw from same taxonomy

**For lifecycle flows:**
- Status transitions must follow allowed paths (can't skip states)
- Terminal states (canonized, rejected, merged) should not transition
- Blocked states must document remediation before progressing

**For cross-taxonomy constraints:**
- TU with deferred:art must have Art Director/Illustrator listed as dormant
- Gatecheck with failed Gateways bar must list gate types with fairness issues
- Uncorroborated:high claims should trigger Researcher wake (or explicit deferral decision)

---

## Next Steps

**For Phase 2 (Field Registry):**
- These taxonomies will define enum types for fields
- Example: `status` field type = enum(proposed | accepted | in-progress | resolved | canonized | deferred | rejected)

**For Phase 3 (Artifacts Refinement):**
- Artifact templates will reference these taxonomies explicitly
- Example: "Status: See taxonomy §2 Hook Status Lifecycle"

**For Phase 4 (Validation Rules):**
- Validation rules will enforce taxonomy constraints
- Example: "If Type=factual, must include Research Posture"

**For Layer 3 (Codification):**
- Each taxonomy becomes JSON enum schema
- Example: `hook-types.schema.json` with values from taxonomy §1

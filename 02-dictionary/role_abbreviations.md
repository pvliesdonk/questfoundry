## Usage Notes

**In TU briefs:** List awake/dormant roles by abbreviation
- Example: `Awake: PW, SS, ST, LW, GK · Dormant: AD, IL, AuD, AuP, TR, RS`

**In hook cards:** Indicate proposed owner and consults
- Example: `Owner (R): ST · Consult: PW, SS, GK`

**In deferral tags:** Reference dormant role areas
- Example: `deferred:art deferred:audio deferred:translation deferred:research`

**In RACI matrices:** Use abbreviations for column headers
- Example: `| Task | SR | GK | PW | SS | ST | ... |`

## Abbreviation Conventions

1. **2-3 characters:** Most are 2 letters, exceptions: AuD, AuP (to distinguish from AD)
2. **Capital letters only:** No lowercase or mixed case
3. **Avoid ambiguity:**
   - ST = Style Lead (not Showrunner or Scene Smith)
   - SS = Scene Smith (not Showrunner or Style)
   - AD = Art Director (not Audio Director)
   - AuD = Audio Director, AuP = Audio Producer (to avoid collision with AD)
4. **First letter(s) of role words:**
   - Single-word roles: First 2 letters (e.g., SR = Showrunner, GK = Gatekeeper)
   - Multi-word roles: First letter of each word (e.g., PW = Plotwright, CC = Codex Curator)

---

## Role Categories

**Core Coordination (2 roles)** — Always active
- Showrunner (SR), Gatekeeper (GK)

**Primary Creative (5 roles)** — Typically active
- Plotwright (PW), Scene Smith (SS), Style Lead (ST), Lore Weaver (LW), Codex Curator (CC)

**Asset Production (5 roles)** — Optional/dormant until activated
- Art Director (AD), Illustrator (IL), Audio Director (AuD), Audio Producer (AuP), Translator (TR)

**Quality & Export (2 roles)** — Active during relevant loops
- Book Binder (BB), Player-Narrator (PN)

**Research (1 role)** — Optional/dormant until activated
- Researcher (RS)

---

## Dormancy Signals

When a role is **dormant**, use deferral tags in TU briefs and hook cards:
- `deferred:art` — AD and IL dormant
- `deferred:audio` — AuD and AuP dormant
- `deferred:translation` — TR dormant
- `deferred:research` — RS dormant

**Format:** Space-separated list (NOT pipe-separated, NOT comma-separated)
- ✅ Correct: `deferred:art deferred:audio deferred:translation`
- ❌ Wrong: `deferred:art | deferred:audio | deferred:translation`

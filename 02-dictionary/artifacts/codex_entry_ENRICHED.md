# Codex Entry — Player-Safe Knowledge (Layer 1, Human-Level)

> **Status:** ✅ **ENRICHED with Layer 2 constraints (Phase 3 — 2025-10-29)**
> This template includes inline field constraints, validation rules, and common error prevention. All Phase 2+3 corrections applied (13 hook types, 7 status values, 8 bars, 13 loops, space-separated deferrals, full research posture values).

> **Use:** Write **player-safe** background pieces that clarify terms, places, procedures, or objects without revealing canon or internal mechanics. Keep entries concise, linkable, and portable across locales. This is a **human template**; no schemas here.

## Mini example (safe)

```

Codex Entry — Union Token
Slug: union-token                      Locale: EN
Owner: Codex Curator                   Edited: 2025-10-28
Snapshot: Cold @ 2025-10-28            TU: TU-2025-10-28-CC03
Lineage: Canon Pack CP-FT-01 · Research Memo RS-FT-02 (posture: plausible)
Register: neutral

1. Overview
   A small badge or card recognized at dock checkpoints to confirm union membership. Inspectors may glance or scan it during routine checks.

2. Usage
   Link on first mention in inspection scenes and at gates where access depends on labor status.
   When not to link: interior scenes after inspection is resolved.
   PN cue: "The foreman's eyes flick to your lapel."

3. Context
   Tokens vary by dock but share a clear emblem and member ID. Visual verification is common; readers should assume inspectors know the emblem by sight in well-lit areas.

4. Variants & Synonyms
   | Variant        | Register/Region | Notes for Translator |
   | union badge    | neutral         | Preferred US/EN; avoid brand-like capitalization |
   | labor token    | neutral         | Works in generic sci-fi; check local idiom       |
   | membership tag | colloquial      | Use sparingly; may read informal                 |

5. Relations (See also)
   Related: inspection-logs ↔ dock-checkpoints
   Taxonomy: credentials → union-token → (none)

6. Accessibility & Presentation
   Reading level: plain
   Alt guidance (if illustrated): "A badge scanner glows as a lapel emblem is held near it at a dock checkpoint."
   Caption guideline: "Sodium lamps smear along wet steel; the scanner's eye waits."
   Link text: "union token requirements" (not "click here").

7. Labels & Anchors (for Binder)
   Anchor slug: /codex/union-token
   Collision risks: none; ASCII kebab-case
   Binder note: group under /codex/credentials

8. Notes
   Avoid implying forgery methods or backstory causes.

9. Lineage & Trace
   From Canon: player-safe summary of inspection strictness (no causes stated).
   Research posture touched: plausible (visual verification norms)
   Hooks filed: hook://translator/union-token (regional variants); hook://curator/inspection-logs (new entry)

```

- `Overview`: Required, 2-5 lines, player-safe, no spoilers/internals/technique
- `Context`: Required, 2-6 lines, diegetic, no hidden causes
- `Variants & Synonyms`: Required table, columns: Variant | Register/Region | Notes for Translator
- `Relations (See also)`: Required, must list related slugs or state "none"

- `Done checklist`: Required, 8 items, all must be ticked before approved/merged

### Cross-Field Validation

- If `Illustrated`, then `Alt guidance` must be present
- If `Alt guidance` or `Caption guideline` present, then cross-media noted in §5 Relations
- `Register` in header must match register values in §4 Variants table (or be compatible)
- `Anchor slug` in §7 must match `Slug` in header
- `Research posture touched` must align with lineage references (e.g., if uncorroborated:*, cite Research Memo)
- All overview/context/variants text must remain player-safe (no spoilers from Canon Pack Hot sections)

### Cross-Artifact Validation

- `TU` ID must reference existing TU Brief artifact
- If `Lineage` references Canon Packs, those must exist with matching IDs
- If `Lineage` references Research Memos, those must exist with matching posture
- All slug references in §5 Relations must resolve to existing or planned Codex Entry artifacts
- `Anchor slug` must not collide with existing codex anchors (checked by Binder)
- Hook URLs in §9 should become actual Hook Card artifacts if not deferred
- If entry uses terms from taxonomies, those must be defined in taxonomies.md

## Common Errors

**❌ Nested research posture format**
- Wrong: `uncorroborated:<low|med|high>`
- Right: `uncorroborated:low | uncorroborated:medium | uncorroborated:high` (flat, space-separated)

**❌ Using "med" abbreviation**
- Wrong: `uncorroborated:med`
- Right: `uncorroborated:medium` (full word per taxonomy §8)

**❌ Spoilers in Overview**
- Wrong: "The foreman is guilty of causing the retrofit accident and now checks badges strictly."
- Right: "A small badge recognized at dock checkpoints to confirm union membership."

**❌ Using technique terms**
- Wrong: "Set flag UNION_BADGE_CHECKED to true"
- Right: "Inspectors may glance or scan it during routine checks."

**❌ Using internal codewords**
- Wrong: "This enables the FOREMAN_GATE_BYPASS route"
- Right: "Visual verification is common in well-lit areas."

**❌ Alt guidance too vague or metaphorical**
- Wrong: "Hope glimmers in the darkness."
- Right: "A badge scanner glows as a lapel emblem is held near it at a dock checkpoint."

**❌ Caption using technique**
- Wrong: "Render sodium lamps with warm LUT and 85mm focal length."
- Right: "Sodium lamps smear along wet steel; the scanner's eye waits."

**❌ Non-descriptive link text**
- Wrong: "Click here for more information."
- Right: "union token requirements" or "dock checkpoint procedures"

**❌ Slug with spaces or uppercase**
- Wrong: `Union Token` or `union_token`
- Right: `union-token` (kebab-case, ASCII)

**❌ Revealing hidden causes in Context**
- Wrong: "The foreman checks badges strictly because of guilt from the retrofit accident."
- Right: "Tokens vary by dock but share a clear emblem. Visual verification is common."

**❌ Missing Variants table**
- Wrong: No variants listed
- Right: At least 1-3 variants with register and translator notes

**❌ Relations with broken slug references**
- Wrong: `related-entry` (slug doesn't exist, no plan to create it)
- Right: `inspection-logs` (existing or planned codex entry)

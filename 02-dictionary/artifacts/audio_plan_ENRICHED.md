# Audio Plan — Cue Specification (Layer 1, Human-Level)

> **Status:** ✅ **ENRICHED with Layer 2 constraints (Phase 3 — 2025-10-29)**
> This template includes inline field constraints, validation rules, and common error prevention. All Phase 2+3 corrections applied.

> **Use:** Specify a cue so an Audio Producer can realize it **without guessing**. Keep player surfaces clean: captions/text equivalents are **in-world**; all technique/repro stays **off-surface**.

## Mini example (safe)

```

Audio Plan — foreman-gate-hum
TU: TU-2025-10-28-AUD03 · Edited: 2025-10-28 · Owner: Audio Director
Slice: Act I — Dock 7 checkpoint
Status: planned

1. Purpose: pace
   Rationale: Lift tension across the inspection lines, then clear before choices.

2. Placement & Envelope
   Placement: under the last two narrative lines; end before the choice list
   Timing note: enter on "scanner blinks," fade by the next sentence's period
   Duration target: 3–4 s
   Duck policy: soft (voice remains primary)

3. Description (no technique)
   What is heard: a low engine hum gently swells, then eases back to the ambient floor
   Salient qualities: steady, distant, short, mechanical
   Readability: must read on laptop/phone speakers

4. Caption / Text Equivalent
   Caption: "[A low engine hum rises, then settles.]"

5. Safety Notes
   Onset: gradual
   Intensity: conservative
   Transients: none
   Content notes: none

6. Inclusion Criteria
   Include when: section mentions dock machinery/inspection at the gate
   Exclude when: interior dialogue after inspection; high-density speech

7. Localization & Style
   Register: neutral
   Idioms to avoid: none
   Translator note: keep concrete and short; avoid culture-specific onomatopoeia

8. Determinism (off-surface)
   Repro expectation: log-only
   Producer fields: session id, chain summary, LUFS target, export hash

9. Handoffs
   Producer: render 1 cue at −16 LUFS integrated; gentle 300 ms fade-in/out
   Style: confirm caption register
   Translator: verify portability (NL/EN)
   PN: confirm no masking of delivery
   Gatekeeper: Presentation/Accessibility spot-check before marking "producing"
   Binder: no asset in View for this pass (plan-only allowed)

10. Checklist
    [✔] purpose  [✔] placement  [✔] caption  [✔] safety  [✔] localization  [✔] off-surface repro

## Common Errors

**❌ Using technique in Description**
- Wrong: "800 Hz lowpass filter, -6dB/octave, with soft clipper at -3dB"
- Right: "a low engine hum gently swells, then eases back"

**❌ Using SMPTE timecode in Placement**
- Wrong: "Placement: 00:02:15.500 to 00:02:19.250"
- Right: "Placement: under the last two narrative lines; end before choice list"

**❌ Missing square brackets in Caption**
- Wrong: Caption: "A low engine hum rises"
- Right: Caption: "[A low engine hum rises, then settles.]"

**❌ Technique in Caption**
- Wrong: Caption: "[Generated with reverb plugin and 300ms tail]"
- Right: Caption: "[A low engine hum rises, then settles.]"

**❌ Missing exclude condition**
- Wrong: "Include when: section mentions dock machinery"
- Right: "Include when: section mentions dock machinery / Exclude when: high-density speech"

**❌ Missing safety notes**
- Wrong: Only Onset and Intensity provided
- Right: All 4 safety fields: Onset, Intensity, Transients, Content notes (even if "none")

**❌ Purpose without rationale**
- Wrong: "Purpose: pace" (no rationale)
- Right: "Purpose: pace / Rationale: Lift tension across inspection, clear before choices"

**❌ Non-descriptive salient qualities**
- Wrong: "Salient qualities: good sound design"
- Right: "Salient qualities: steady, distant, short, mechanical"

**❌ Missing duck policy when under speech**
- Wrong: "Placement: under lines 3-5" (no duck policy)
- Right: "Placement: under lines 3-5 / Duck policy: soft (voice remains primary)"

**❌ Producer logs in player-facing caption**
- Wrong: Caption: "[Rendered at -16 LUFS, session abc123]"
- Right: Caption in §4 is player-safe; producer logs stay in §8 off-surface

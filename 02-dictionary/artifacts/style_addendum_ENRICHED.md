# Style Addendum — Patterns & Examples (Layer 1, Human-Level)

> **Status:** ✅ **ENRICHED with Layer 2 constraints (Phase 3 — 2025-10-29)**
> This template includes inline field constraints, validation rules, and common error prevention. All Phase 2+3 corrections applied (13 hook types, 7 status values, 8 bars, 13 loops, space-separated deferrals).

> **Use:** Capture **repeatable patterns** and **tiny examples** the owners can apply without rewrites. This addendum supplements the house style with *slice-specific* guidance (register, banned/preferred forms, PN phrasing, captions/alt). Keep it **player-safe**: no spoilers, no internals.

## 1) Register & Voice (slice-specific)

<!-- Field: Register | Type: enum | Optional: yes | Values: neutral | formal | colloquial (and who uses it) -->
<!-- Field: Voice & Address | Type: markdown | Required: yes | Pronouns, formality, directness -->
<!-- Field: Tense / Aspect / Mood | Type: markdown | Required: yes | Tense policy for narrative -->
<!-- Validation: Cadence guidance must be concrete (e.g., "short lines near choices") -->
<!-- Cross-field: If conflicts with global policy, must escalate for ADR -->

- **Register:** <neutral | formal | colloquial> (and who uses it)
- **Cadence:** <short lines near choices | longer in travel beats | …>
- **Pronouns & address:** <2nd person direct; titles for officials; …>
- **Tense/aspect:** <present-simple; avoid progressive; …>

> *If this conflicts with global policy, escalate for ADR.*

---

## 2) Banned / Preferred (delta)

<!-- Field: Banned / Preferred | Type: markdown-list | Required: yes | Forbidden/preferred phrases -->
<!-- Validation: Keep concise; include only what changed for this slice (delta to global style) -->
<!-- Cross-field: Must align with PN Patterns (§3) and Scene-Level Patterns (§4) -->

> Keep this concise; include only what changed for this slice.

- **Ban:** "Option locked", "Proceed", "You must…", "Click…"
- **Prefer:** Diegetic refusals; intent-forward choice labels (verb + object)

---

## 3) PN Patterns (player-facing phrasing)

<!-- Field: PN Patterns | Type: markdown-list | Required: yes | Localized reusable patterns -->
<!-- Validation: Must include at least: gate refusal, choice labels, micro-recap patterns -->
<!-- Cross-field: Examples must align with register (§1) and banned/preferred (§2) -->

- **Gate refusal (pattern):**
  "\<world cue\>. '\<short in-world check/refusal\>'"
  *Ex:* "The scanner blinks red. 'Union badge?'"

- **Choice labels (pattern):**
  "\<verb\> \<object/place\>" vs "\<verb\> \<person\>" (contrast of *approach*)
  *Ex:* "Slip through maintenance / Face the foreman."

- **Micro-recap (≤2 lines):**
  "\<state change\>. \<current stakes\>."

---

## 4) Scene-Level Patterns (owners apply)

<!-- Field: Scene-Level Patterns | Type: markdown-list | Optional: yes | Guidance for Scene Smith application -->
<!-- Validation: Keep actionable; avoid abstract directives -->

- **Context line before choices (if needed):** one line that clarifies *why* the options differ.
- **Show, don't lecture:** swap exposition for a physical cue when a term is in the **Codex**.
- **Diegetic time pressure:** concrete sensory tick ("dock klaxon", "clock sweep") rather than meta countdowns.

---

## 5) Captions & Alt (art/audio surfaces)

<!-- Field: Caption guideline | Type: markdown | Optional: yes | One line, atmospheric/clarifying; no technique -->
<!-- Field: Alt guidance | Type: markdown | Optional: yes | One sentence — subject + relation + location; spoiler-safe -->
<!-- Validation: Caption must be same register as prose, no technique (DAW/plugins/seeds/models) -->
<!-- Validation: Alt must be spoiler-safe, descriptive, one sentence -->

- **Caption rule:** one line, atmospheric/clarifying; **no technique**; same register as prose.
- **Alt rule:** one sentence — **subject + relation + location**; spoiler-safe.
- **Examples (portable):**
  - Caption: "Sodium lamps smear along wet steel; the scanner's eye waits."
  - Alt: "A foreman's shadow falls across a badge scanner at a dock checkpoint."

---

## 6) Translator Notes (portability)

<!-- Field: Translator Notes | Type: markdown-list | Optional: yes | Portability guidance for localization -->
<!-- Validation: Focus on culture-bound idioms, anchor policy, formality distinctions -->

- Avoid culture-bound idioms near choices.
- Keep anchors kebab-case ASCII if policy-bound; coordinate renames with Binder.
- Provide variants for occupational titles if target locale distinguishes formality sharply.

---

## 7) Tiny Before → After (player-safe)

<!-- Field: Before → After | Type: table | Optional: yes | Concrete line edits with owner -->
<!-- Validation: Columns must be: Location | Issue | Before | After | Owner -->
<!-- Cross-artifact: Locations should reference manuscript sections; owners must be valid roles -->

| Location | Issue | Before | After | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/manuscript/act1/foreman-gate#entry` | `choice-ambiguity` | "Go / Proceed." | "Slip through maintenance / Face the foreman." | Scene |
| `/manuscript/act1/foreman-gate#scanner` | `meta-gate` | "Option locked: missing CODEWORD." | "The scanner blinks red. 'Union badge?'" | Scene |

---

## 8) Accessibility nudges

<!-- Field: Accessibility nudges | Type: markdown-list | Optional: yes | Short sentences, concrete subjects guidance -->
<!-- Validation: Keep actionable; focus on readability near choices -->

- Short sentences within 2 lines of a choice list.
- Avoid stacked prepositional phrases; prefer concrete subjects.
- Ensure caption meaning matches audio/image perception (no metaphor-only captions).

---

## 9) Hooks & Hand-offs

<!-- Field: Hooks filed | Type: markdown-list | Optional: yes | Follow-up hooks for curator/translator -->
<!-- Field: Hand-offs | Type: markdown | Optional: yes | Who applies what from this addendum -->
<!-- Validation: Hook format: hook://<domain>/<topic> with description -->

- Hooks: `hook://curator/union-token` (glossary anchor); `hook://translator/gate-phrasing` (register variants).
- Hand-offs: Scene applies line edits; PN adopts patterns; Translator localizes examples; Gatekeeper pre-gates Presentation.

   Pronouns: second person; titles for officials
   Tense: present simple

2. Banned / Preferred

### Cross-Field Validation

- If `Register` conflicts with global policy, must note escalation for ADR
- `PN Patterns` examples must align with `Register` (§1) and `Banned / Preferred` (§2)
- `Caption guideline` and `Alt guidance` must match `Register` (same formality level)
- If `Before → After` table present, owners must be valid Layer 1 roles
- `Neighbors` list must include all roles affected by patterns (at minimum: @scene, @pn)

### Cross-Artifact Validation

- `TU` ID must reference existing TU Brief artifact
- If `Before → After` table references manuscript locations, those should exist or be planned
- Hook URLs in §9 should become actual Hook Card artifacts if not deferred
- If patterns reference Codex entries, those should exist or be planned
- `Neighbors` roles should receive notification (mentioned in downstream handoff)

## Common Errors

**❌ Meta language in PN patterns**
- Wrong: "Option locked: missing CODEWORD."
- Right: "The scanner blinks red. 'Union badge?'"

**❌ Using technique in captions**
- Wrong: "Render with 85mm lens, warm LUT, f/1.8 aperture."
- Right: "Sodium lamps smear along wet steel; the scanner's eye waits."

**❌ Vague or metaphorical alt text**
- Wrong: "Hope and despair collide."
- Right: "A foreman's shadow falls across a badge scanner at a dock checkpoint."

**❌ Non-actionable PN patterns**
- Wrong: "Be creative with gate refusals."
- Right: "\<world cue\>. '\<short in-world check/refusal\>'" with example

**❌ Choice labels without verb+object pattern**
- Wrong: "Option A / Option B"
- Right: "Slip through maintenance / Face the foreman."

**❌ Changing global policy without escalation**
- Wrong: Register: "Use past tense for all narrative" (conflicts with global present-simple policy)
- Right: Note conflict and escalate for ADR if needed

**❌ Missing required PN pattern types**
- Wrong: Only gate refusal pattern provided
- Right: All three required: gate refusal, choice labels, micro-recap

**❌ Before → After table with invalid owner**
- Wrong: Owner = "Bob"
- Right: Owner = "Scene" or "PN" or other valid Layer 1 role

**❌ Spoilers in player-facing patterns**
- Wrong: Micro-recap: "You avoided the foreman who is guilty of the retrofit accident."
- Right: Micro-recap: "You kept the badge pocketed. The inspection line tightens."

**❌ Unchecked Done checklist at handoff**
- Wrong: Handing off with 3/7 items unchecked
- Right: All 7 items must be ticked before handoff

# Hook Card — Small, Traceable Follow-Up (Layer 2, Enriched)

> **Use:** Capture a **new need or uncertainty** without derailing the current TU. Hooks are small, classified, and routed to the right lane. Keep the **player-safe summary** clean; any spoilers live under **Hot Details**.
>
> **Status:** ✨ **ENRICHED with Layer 2 constraints (Phase 3, 2025-10-29)**

- [ ] Acceptance criteria tied to Bars
- [ ] Dormancy decision recorded (if applicable)
- [ ] Locations & lineage linked; trace updated

## Validation Rules (for Layer 3 schemas)

### Field-Level Validation

**ID:**

- Format: `HK-YYYYMMDD-\d{2,3}` (e.g., `HK-20251029-01`)
- Must be unique across all Hook Cards in Hot
- YYYYMMDD must be valid date
- Seq starts at 01, increments per day

**Status:**

- Must be one of 7 values from taxonomies.md §2
- Transitions must follow lifecycle flow:
  - `proposed` → `accepted | deferred | rejected`
  - `accepted` → `in-progress | deferred`
  - `in-progress` → `resolved | deferred`
  - `resolved` → `canonized | in-progress` (if reopened)
  - `deferred` → `accepted | rejected` (if reactivated/abandoned)
  - `canonized`, `rejected` are terminal (no further transitions)

**Raised by:**

- Must be valid role name from Layer 1 ROLE_INDEX.md
- Abbreviations accepted if formally defined

**TU:**

- Must reference existing TU Brief artifact
- Format depends on TU ID scheme (typically `TU-YYYY-MM-DD-<role><seq>`)

**Edited:**

- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD` (ISO 8601 date only, no time)
- Must be valid date

**Type (primary):**

- Must be one of 13 values from taxonomies.md §1
- Cannot be same as Secondary type

**Secondary (optional):**

- If present, must be one of 13 values from taxonomies.md §1
- Cannot be same as primary type

**Bars affected:**

- Must be comma-separated list of bar names from taxonomies.md §5
- All 8 bars are valid: Integrity, Reachability, Nonlinearity, Gateways, Style, Determinism, Presentation, Accessibility
- At least one bar required

**Blocking?:**

- Must be either `no` or `yes (reason)`
- If `yes`, must include explanation in parentheses

**Player-Safe Summary:**

- Length: 1-3 lines (soft limit, ~300 chars max)
- Must not contain: spoilers, codewords, internal IDs, gate logic, Hot canon, technique terms
- Presentation bar validation required

**Loop:**

- Must be one of 13 loop names from taxonomies.md §3
- Loop name must use Title Case with hyphens (e.g., "Style Tune-up")

**Owner (R):**

- Must be valid role name from Layer 1 ROLE_INDEX.md

**Deferral tags:**

- If present, must be space-separated (NOT comma-separated) list
- Values must be from taxonomies.md §7: `deferred:art`, `deferred:audio`, `deferred:translation`, `deferred:research`

**Locations:**

- Must be valid anchor paths: `/manuscript/...#anchor` or `/codex/...`
- Paths validated by Binder during dry bind (integrity check)

### Cross-Field Validation

**If Blocking? = yes:**

- Then Bars affected must include at least one bar
- Player-Safe Summary should explain impact

**If Status = deferred:**

- Then §6 Dormancy & Deferrals must be filled
- Must include: Deferral tags, Fallback, Revisit

**If Status = rejected:**

- Then §8 Resolution must include rejection reason in Decision field

**If Status = canonized:**

- Then §8 Resolution must be filled
- Locations should link to Cold source where hook was embedded

**If Status = resolved, canonized, or rejected:**

- Then §8 Resolution must be completely filled (all fields)

**If Deferral tags set:**

- Then Fallback and Revisit fields in §6 are required

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Bars mentioned should be subset of "Bars affected" in §1
- At least one criterion required

### Cross-Artifact Validation

**TU ID:**

- Must reference existing TU Brief artifact in Hot
- TU Brief should list this hook in deliverables or trace

**Related hooks:**

- All Hook IDs must reference existing Hook Cards
- No self-references (hook cannot relate to itself)

**Locations:**

- Anchor paths must resolve to valid sections (checked by Binder)
- Codex entries referenced must exist

**Lineage:**

- Canon Pack IDs must reference existing Canon Packs
- Research Memo IDs must reference existing Research Memos
- ADR IDs must reference existing ADRs

**Owner (R):**

- Role must be appropriate for chosen Loop (see RACI matrices in Layer 1)

## Common Errors

### ❌ Wrong Status Values

**Wrong:** `Status: open | dropped`
**Right:** `Status: proposed | accepted | in-progress | resolved | canonized | deferred | rejected`

**Why:** Old template used incorrect lifecycle terms. Use taxonomies.md §2 values.

---

### ❌ Wrong Hook Type

**Wrong:** `Type: terminology`
**Right:** `Type: taxonomy`

**Why:** Correct term is "taxonomy" for coverage gaps and terminology issues.

---

### ❌ Missing Hook Types

**Wrong:** Only listing structure, canon, style/pn, translation, art, audio, binder/nav, accessibility
**Right:** Include all 13 types: narrative, scene, factual, taxonomy, structure, canon, research, style/pn, translation, art, audio, binder/nav, accessibility

**Why:** narrative, scene, factual, and research were missing from original template.

---

### ❌ Missing Determinism Bar

**Wrong:** `Bars affected: Integrity, Reachability, Nonlinearity, Gateways, Style, Presentation, Accessibility` (7 bars)
**Right:** Include Determinism: `Integrity, Reachability, Nonlinearity, Gateways, Style, Determinism, Presentation, Accessibility` (8 bars)

**Why:** Determinism is the 8th mandatory bar per QUALITY_BARS.md.

---

### ❌ Missing Loops

**Wrong:** Only listing 9 loops, missing Hook Harvest and export loops
**Right:** Include all 13 loops: Story Spark, Hook Harvest, Lore Deepening, Codex Expansion, Style Tune-up, Art Touch-up, Audio Pass, Translation Pass, Binding Run, Narration Dry-Run, Gatecheck, Post-Mortem, Archive Snapshot

**Why:** Template was incomplete. See LOOPS/ directory for all loops.

---

### ❌ Meta/Spoiler Language in Player-Safe Summary

**Wrong:** "Option locked: need reputation>=5 to unlock foreman dialogue"
**Right:** "The foreman won't speak without recognizing you from prior dock work."

**Why:** Player-Safe Summary must be diegetic, no codewords, no mechanics, no spoilers.

---

### ❌ Hook Type Too Broad

**Wrong:** Using `canon` for everything
**Right:** Use narrowest type: `scene` over `narrative`, `taxonomy` over `canon`, `factual` over `canon`

**Why:** Specific types route to correct roles faster.

---

### ❌ Missing Acceptance Criteria Tied to Bars

**Wrong:** "Fix the gate issue"
**Right:** "Gate refusal is diegetic (Gateways green); labels contrastive (Style green); PN dry-run confirms cadence"

**Why:** Criteria must be specific and tied to Quality Bars for gatecheck validation.

---

### ❌ Comma-Separated Deferral Tags

**Wrong:** `deferred:art, deferred:audio, deferred:translation`
**Right:** `deferred:art deferred:audio deferred:translation` (space-separated)

**Why:** Field registry specifies space-separated list format.

---

### ❌ Inconsistent Loop Name Format

**Wrong:** `style_tuneup` or `STYLE-TUNEUP`
**Right:** `Style Tune-up` (Title Case with hyphens)

**Why:** Display names use Title Case; file names use kebab-case. Templates use display format.

---

## Mini examples (safe)

**A) Style/PN — choice clarity**

```

2. Player-Safe Summary
   "Choice labels read as near-synonyms; need intent-forward wording."

3. Proposed Next Step
   Loop: Style Tune-up
   Owner: Style Lead (R) · A: Showrunner · Consult: Scene, Gatekeeper

4. Acceptance Criteria

* Choices read as different intents (Style green)

* PN dry-run confirms cadence

7. Locations & Links
   /manuscript/act1/foreman-gate#entry
   Related: HK-20251028-03 (gate phrasing)

```

**B) Taxonomy — codex entry needed (Curator)**

```

Hook Card — "Inspection Logs entry"
ID: HK-20251029-02 · Status: proposed
Raised by: Style · TU: TU-2025-10-29-ST02 · Edited: 2025-10-29
Slice: Act I — Checkpoint

1. Classification
   Type: taxonomy     Bars: Integrity, Presentation     Blocking?: no

2. Player-Safe Summary
   "Add a codex entry for 'Inspection Logs' to clarify references in gate scenes."

3. Hot Details
   "Underlying causes exist; Lore already answered in CP-FT-01."

4. Proposed Next Step
   Loop: Codex Expansion
   Owner: Codex Curator · Consult: Lore (player-safe summary), Translator (variants)

5. Acceptance Criteria

* Entry with Overview/Usage/Context/See-also/Lineage
* Anchors resolve; no orphans in dry bind

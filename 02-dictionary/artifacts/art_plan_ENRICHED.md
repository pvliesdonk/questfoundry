# Art Plan — Slot Specification (Layer 1, Human-Level)

> **Status:** ✅ **ENRICHED with Layer 2 constraints (Phase 3 — 2025-10-29)**
> This template includes inline field constraints, validation rules, and common error prevention. All Phase 2+3 corrections applied (13 hook types, 7 status values, 8 bars, 13 loops, space-separated deferrals).

> **Use:** Specify an illustration slot so an Illustrator can execute without guessing. Keep **player surfaces** clean: captions/alt are **in-world**; all technique/repro stays **off-surface**.

Art Plan — foreman-gate-signpost
TU: TU-2025-10-28-AD02 · Edited: 2025-10-28 · Owner: Art Director
Slice: Act I — Dock 7 checkpoint
Status: planned

1. Purpose: signpost
   Rationale: Readers hesitate at the gate; show what matters (badge vs scanner).

2. Subject & Focal
   Subject: lapel area and dock badge scanner
   Focal affordance: badge region vs scanner "eye"

3. Composition Intent
   Framing: tight · Angle: slight low · Distance: close
   Hierarchy: badge area → scanner light → foreman silhouette
   Legibility at size: badge region must read at thumbnail

4. Iconography & Motifs
   Include: wet steel, sodium lamp smear
   Avoid: syndicate symbols (spoiler risk)

5. Light / Palette / Texture
   Light: sodium lamp glow; scanner LED
   Palette: muted steel, amber highlights
   Texture: wet metal; worn jacket fabric

6. Environment & Props
   Location tells: dock railing; industrial signage shapes (no readable text)

7. Characters & Poses
   Visible: foreman silhouette shoulder/hand
   Pose: hand near scanner; face not shown (keeps neutrality)

8. Inclusion Criteria
   Include when: sections invoking inspection/access control at Dock 7
   Exclude when: post-inspection interiors

9. Caption & Alt
   Caption: "Sodium lamps smear along wet steel; the scanner's eye waits."
   Alt: "A foreman's shadow falls across a badge scanner at a dock checkpoint."

10. Variants / Crops
    Variants: tighter crop for mobile if badge area shrinks below legibility
    Selection rule: choose tight variant when width < 480 px

11. Placement & Anchors
    Anchors: /manuscript/act1/foreman-gate#inspection
    Placement: directly above choice list the first time the gate appears
    Risks: none; slug confirmed kebab-case ASCII

12. Accessibility & Localization
    Accessibility: high contrast at focal; avoid glare; clear silhouette
    Localization: caption portable; no idioms; Curator terms align ("badge scanner")

13. Determinism (off-surface)
    Repro expectation: log-only
    Producer fields: session id, model/seed OR capture settings, export hash

14. Handoffs
    Illustrator by: 2025-10-30; Style/Translator review of caption tomorrow; Binder dry bind after render

15. Checklist
    [✔] purpose  [✔] focal  [✔] caption/alt  [✔] anchors  [✔] accessibility  [✔] off-surface repro

```

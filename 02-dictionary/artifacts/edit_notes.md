# Edit Notes — Small, Surgical Changes (Layer 1, Human-Level)

> **Status:** ✅ **ENRICHED with Layer 2 constraints (Phase 3 — 2025-10-30)**
> Inline field constraints and validation rules. All Phase 2+3 corrections applied (8 bars).

> **Use:** Propose **line-level** fixes without changing structure or canon. Keep examples **player-safe**; no spoilers, no internals. Owners apply the edits in their lanes.

## 1) Summary (2–4 bullets)

<!-- Field: Summary | Type: markdown-list | Required: yes | 2-4 bullets explaining context -->
<!-- Validation: Must explain why edits exist, what not to change, who applies, dormancy tags -->

- <why these edits exist; smallest viable fix per bar>
- <what not to change (structure/canon/anchors)>
- <who applies which group of edits>
- <any dormancy tags left intact, e.g., deferred:art>

## 2) Before → After (player-safe exemplars)

<!-- Field: Before → After | Type: table | Required: yes | Surgical line edits -->
<!-- Columns: Location (path#anchor) | Issue tag | Before | After | Owner | Rationale -->
<!-- Validation: All snippets must be player-safe, no spoilers, no internals -->
<!-- Cross-artifact: Locations should reference existing manuscript/codex anchors -->

> Provide **surgical** replacements. Do not reveal canon or internal logic. One or two lines per item.

| Location (path#anchor)                  | Issue tag          | Before                             | After                                           | Owner   | Rationale                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------- |
| `/manuscript/act1/foreman-gate#entry`   | `choice-ambiguity` | "Go / Proceed."                    | "Slip through maintenance / Face the foreman."  | Scene   | Make options contrastive.  |
| `/manuscript/act1/foreman-gate#scanner` | `meta-gate`        | "Option locked: missing CODEWORD." | "The scanner blinks red. 'Union badge?'"        | Scene   | Diegetic refusal; PN-safe. |
| `/codex/union-token`                    | `register`         | "Badge credential is mandated."    | "Dock inspections often require a union token." | Curator | Plain, portable phrasing.  |

> **Issue tags (suggested):** `choice-ambiguity`, `meta-gate`, `tone-wobble`, `caption-technique`, `alt-vague`, `label-collision`, `accessibility`.

# TU Brief — Small, Focused Loop (Layer 2, Enriched)

> **Use this to open a timeboxed task unit (TU).** Keep it one sitting, wake only needed roles, cite the bars you'll press, and define what "done" means. Views are cut from **Cold**; never ship Hot.
>
> **Status:** ✨ **ENRICHED with Layer 2 constraints (Phase 3, 2025-10-29)**

Gatecheck: @gatekeeper (confirm diegetic phrasing; no meta)

## Escalation

Trigger: if gate fairness questioned → Plot lane decision
Lane: Plotwright (owner) · Record: TU note

## Trace

## Reminders

- **Small slice or it's not a TU.** If scope balloons, split and chain.
- **Bars beat vibes.** Name which bars you'll flip to green.
- **Dormancy is explicit.** Use `deferred:*` tags and front-matter notes (Binder).
- **Never ship from Hot.** Cold-only for Views; Binder states options & coverage.
- **Record decisions.** If you set precedent, write an ADR (`../../DECISIONS/`).

## Validation Rules (for Layer 3 schemas)

### Field-Level Validation

**ID:**
- Format: `TU-YYYY-MM-DD-<role><seq>` (e.g., `TU-2025-10-28-ST01`)
- YYYY-MM-DD must be valid date
- Role code typically 2-4 chars (ST, PW, LW, etc.)
- Seq starts at 01, increments per role per day
- Must be unique across all TUs

**Opened:**
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD` (ISO 8601 date only)
- Must be valid date
- Typically matches date in TU ID

**Owner (A):**
- Must be valid role name from Layer 1 ROLE_INDEX
- Usually "Showrunner" or "SR"

**Responsible (R):**
- Comma-separated list of role names
- Each role must exist in Layer 1 ROLE_INDEX
- At least one role required

**Loop:**
- Must be one of 13 loop names from taxonomies.md §3
- Title Case with hyphens (e.g., "Style Tune-up")
- Allowed values:
  - Discovery: Story Spark, Hook Harvest, Lore Deepening
  - Refinement: Codex Expansion, Style Tune-up
  - Asset: Art Touch-up, Audio Pass, Translation Pass
  - Export: Binding Run, Narration Dry-Run, Gatecheck, Post-Mortem, Archive Snapshot

**Slice:**
- Player-safe markdown, 1-2 lines
- No spoilers, no internal IDs, no mechanics

**Snapshot context:**
- Format: `Cold @ YYYY-MM-DD` or link format with mailto
- Must reference valid Cold snapshot date

**Awake:**
- Comma-separated list of role abbreviations
- Each role must exist in Layer 1 ROLE_INDEX
- Should align with chosen Loop (see RACI matrices)

**Dormant:**
- Comma-separated list of role abbreviations
- Should be complement of Awake roles (all roles either awake or dormant)

**Deferral tags:**
- Space-separated list (NOT pipe or comma)
- Values from taxonomies.md §7: `deferred:art deferred:audio deferred:translation deferred:research`

**Press (Bars):**
- Comma or space-separated list of bar names
- Must be from taxonomies.md §5 (8 bars total)
- All 8 bars valid: Integrity, Reachability, Nonlinearity, Gateways, Style, Determinism, Presentation, Accessibility

**Monitor (Bars):**
- Same format as Press
- Should not overlap with Press (either press or monitor, not both)

**Pre-gate risks:**
- Markdown bullet list
- Each risk should be specific and testable

**Inputs:**
- Markdown bullet list
- Each input should be concrete prerequisite

**Deliverables:**
- Markdown bullet list
- Each deliverable should be concrete artifact

**Bars green:**
- Bar name list (subset of Press bars typically)
- These bars must pass gatecheck before TU closes

**Merge/View:**
- Markdown describing merge decision
- Must state if Binder involved

**Timebox:**
- Duration in minutes or "X-Y min" format
- Typical range: 45-90 min
- If >90 min, consider splitting TU

**Checkpoint:**
- Time in HH:MM format or duration from start
- Optional mid-TU review point

**Handoffs:**
- Markdown describing who receives what and when
- Should align with Deliverables

**Trigger (Escalation):**
- One-sentence condition for escalation
- Should be decision-focused, not vague

**Lane (Escalation):**
- Role name who owns escalation
- Must exist in Layer 1 ROLE_INDEX
- See escalation_rules.md for routing

**Record (Escalation):**
- Where escalation is documented
- Options: TU note, Addendum, Pack, View Log, ADR

**Tracelog:**
- Path to TU log file
- Typically: `/logs/tu/<TU-ID>.md`

**Linkage:**
- Markdown describing trace connections
- Hooks filed, snapshot/view impact

### Cross-Field Validation

**If Deferral tags set:**
- Then Dormant should include corresponding roles (AD/IL for art, AuD/AuP for audio, TR for translation, RS for research)
- Deliverables should note deferred status

**If Loop requires specific roles:**
- Awake must include those roles (see RACI by loop)
- Example: Style Tune-up requires ST (Style Lead) awake

**Press bars + Monitor bars:**
- Should not overlap (bar is either pressed or monitored, not both)
- Union of Press + Monitor should not exceed 8 bars

**Bars green:**
- Should be subset of Press bars
- Cannot include bars that are only Monitored

**If Merge/View mentions "cut a View":**
- Then Binder (BB) should be in Awake roles

**If Snapshot context date:**
- Should be <= Opened date (can't snapshot from future)

**Timebox vs Deliverables:**
- If many deliverables, timebox should be longer
- If timebox >90 min and many deliverables, warn about TU size

### Cross-Artifact Validation

**Loop:**
- Must match one of the loop files in `00-north-star/LOOPS/`
- RACI matrix for that loop should define roles in Awake

**Responsible (R) roles:**
- Should be Responsible in RACI for chosen Loop
- Owner (A) should be Accountable in RACI

**Inputs:**
- If references TU IDs, they must exist
- If references Canon Packs, they must exist
- If references Style Addendum, it must exist

**Deliverables:**
- Hook Cards created must reference this TU ID
- Artifacts listed must be traceable

**Tracelog path:**
- If specified, directory must exist or be creatable

## Common Errors

### ❌ Wrong Loop Count

**Wrong:** Only listing 10 loops (missing Hook Harvest, Gatecheck, Post-Mortem, Archive Snapshot)
**Right:** Include all 13 loops from taxonomies.md §3

**Why:** Template was incomplete. All 13 loops are valid TU types.

---

### ❌ Missing Determinism Bar

**Wrong:** `Press: Integrity, Reachability, Nonlinearity, Gateways, Style, Presentation, Accessibility` (7 bars)
**Right:** `Press: Integrity, Reachability, Nonlinearity, Gateways, Style, Determinism, Presentation, Accessibility` (8 bars)

**Why:** Determinism is the 8th mandatory bar per QUALITY_BARS.md.

---

### ❌ Wrong Deferral Tag Separator

**Wrong:** `deferred:art | deferred:audio` (pipe) or `deferred:art · deferred:audio` (middle-dot)
**Right:** `deferred:art deferred:audio` (space-separated)

**Why:** Field registry specifies space-separated format for deferral tags.

---

### ❌ Scope Too Large

**Wrong:** "Act I — all scenes" with 20 deliverables and 120 min timebox
**Right:** "Act I — Foreman Gate (3 sections)" with 3-5 deliverables and 60 min timebox

**Why:** TUs must fit in one sitting (45-90 min). Split large work into multiple chained TUs.

---

### ❌ Bars Not Tied to Deliverables

**Wrong:** Press: Integrity, Style | Deliverables: Gateway map, TU log
**Right:** Press: Integrity, Reachability, Gateways | Deliverables: Gateway map with reachability check, TU log

**Why:** Bars pressed should match deliverable types. Gateway map presses Gateways bar.

---

### ❌ Dormancy Not Explicit

**Wrong:** Awake: ST, SS | Dormant: (empty)
**Right:** Awake: ST, GK, SS | Dormant: AD, IL, AuD, AuP, TR, LW, CC, BB, PN, RS | Deferral tags: deferred:art deferred:audio deferred:translation deferred:research

**Why:** All 15 roles must be either awake or dormant. Deferral tags explain why optional tracks are dormant.

---

### ❌ Undefined Role Abbreviations

**Wrong:** Using "SL" for Style Lead
**Right:** Using "ST" for Style Lead (per Layer 1 role index)

**Why:** Role abbreviations must be consistent. Formal list needed in Layer 1.

---

### ❌ Timebox Mismatch with Loop

**Wrong:** Loop: Translation Pass | Timebox: 30 min
**Right:** Loop: Translation Pass | Timebox: 60-90 min (multilingual work takes longer)

**Why:** Different loops have different typical timeboxes. See LOOPS/ docs for guidance.

---

### ❌ Pre-gate Skipped

**Wrong:** Gatekeeper: (only Gatecheck listed)
**Right:** Gatekeeper: Pre-gate @gatekeeper (sample lines); Gatecheck @gatekeeper (final validation)

**Why:** Pre-gate catches issues early, prevents wasted work. Always pre-gate before significant effort.

---

### ❌ No Trace Linkage

**Wrong:** Trace: (empty)
**Right:** Trace: Tracelog /logs/tu/<ID>.md | Linkage: hooks filed @ /hot/hooks/<names> | Snapshot impact: none (text-only)

**Why:** Every TU must be traceable. Lineage is critical for understanding work history.

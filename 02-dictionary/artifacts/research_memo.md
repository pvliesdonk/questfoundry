# Research Memo — Question → Answer → Posture → Neutral Phrasing (Layer 1, Human-Level)

> **Status:** ✅ **ENRICHED with Layer 2 constraints (Phase 3 — 2025-10-29)**
> This template includes inline field constraints, validation rules, and common error prevention. All Phase 2+3 corrections applied (13 hook types, 7 status values, 8 bars, 13 loops, space-separated deferrals, full research posture values).

> **Use:** Answer the **smallest useful question** with a short, sourced summary. Label **posture**, provide **player-safe neutral phrasing**, and name **creative implications**. Hot can hold citations; outward text stays spoiler-free.

## Mini example (safe)

```
Research Memo — Dock badge cloning
TU: TU-2025-10-28-RS01 · Edited: 2025-10-28 · Owner: Researcher
Slice: Act I — Foreman Gate
Stakeholders: @plot @lore @style @curator @translator @gatekeeper

1) Question
Q: Can a dock badge be cloned with off-the-shelf gear?
Where it appears: /manuscript/act1/foreman-gate#inspection
Why it matters: gate fairness and loop-with-difference route

2) Short Answer
Cloning is **plausible with insider access**; commodity readers resist trivial duplication. Visual checks by staff commonly prevent simple spoofing.

3) Evidence (Hot)
- Trade whitepaper on RFID dock passes — common anti-clone features
- Security conf talk — attack requires firmware access
- Industry forum summary — visual verification policy norms

4) Posture
Posture: plausible
Caveats: variations across docks; outdated readers exist but not typical

5) Neutral Phrasing
- "The scanner hesitates. The foreman studies your lapel."
- "The reader blinks, then waits for the guard's nod."

6) Risks & Mitigations
Risks: implying illegal methods; glamorizing tampering
Mitigations: avoid how-to details; keep lines observational

7) Creative Implications
Plotwright: allow insider route as loop-with-difference; otherwise enforce visual check
Lore: invariant — tokens must be visually verifiable under dock lighting
Style/PN: adopt diegetic refusal pattern; keep sentences short near choices
Curator/Translator: add **Union Token** entry; ensure label localizes cleanly
Gatekeeper: watch for meta language like "option locked"

8) Hooks
hook://research/reader-firmware — prevalence of vulnerable models (defer)
```

## Validation Rules (for Layer 3 schemas)

### Field-Level Validation

- `Title`: Required, topic / question short name
- `TU`: Must match format `TU-YYYY-MM-DD-<role><seq>`, reference existing TU Brief
- `Edited`: Must be YYYY-MM-DD format, cannot be future date
- `Owner`: Must be "Researcher" (role from Layer 1 role index)
- `Slice`: Required, 1-2 lines, player-safe scope description
- `Stakeholders`: Required role list, must use valid Layer 1 role names (@plot, @lore, @style, @curator, @translator, @gatekeeper)
- `Question`: Required, one line, framed in surface language
- `Where it appears`: Required, manuscript location or codex entry or caption
- `Why it matters`: Required, must be one of: gate fairness | safety | terminology | tone (or similar)
- `Short Answer`: Required, 2-5 lines, plain language, no jargon, no spoilers
- `Evidence (Hot)`: Required, 2-5 sources with URLs/DOIs in Hot, 1 line relevance each
- `Posture`: Required, must be one of 6 flat values: corroborated | plausible | disputed | uncorroborated:low | uncorroborated:medium | uncorroborated:high (NOT nested format)
- `Caveats`: Optional, bullets on gaps/contention/edge cases
- `Neutral Phrasing`: Required, 1-3 lines, no technique/codewords, player-safe
- `Risks & Mitigations`: Required, must cover safety/culture/legal if applicable, plain language
- `Creative Implications`: Required, must include at least 5 roles (Plotwright, Lore, Style/PN, Curator/Translator, Gatekeeper)
- `Hooks filed`: Optional, format: hook://<domain>/<topic>
- `Done checklist`: Required, 6 items, all must be ticked before approved/merged

### Cross-Field Validation

- If `Posture` is not "corroborated", then `Neutral Phrasing` (§5) must be present
- Number and quality of sources in `Evidence (Hot)` must support `Posture` level
- `Creative Implications` must be actionable and align with `Short Answer`
- `Risks & Mitigations` must address all identified risks
- `Neutral Phrasing` must remain player-safe (no spoilers from `Short Answer` or `Evidence`)

### Cross-Artifact Validation

- `TU` ID must reference existing TU Brief artifact
- `Where it appears` should reference existing manuscript sections or codex entries
- `Stakeholders` roles must use valid Layer 1 role names
- Hook URLs in §8 should become actual Hook Card artifacts if not deferred
- If implications reference Canon Pack invariants, those should be documented

## Common Errors

**❌ Nested posture format**
- Wrong: `uncorroborated:<low|med|high>`
- Right: `uncorroborated:low | uncorroborated:medium | uncorroborated:high` (flat, space-separated)

**❌ Using "med" abbreviation**
- Wrong: `uncorroborated:med`
- Right: `uncorroborated:medium` (full word per taxonomy §8)

**❌ Jargon in Short Answer**
- Wrong: "RFID cloning via UID byte manipulation is plausible with ISO 14443A Type 2 tags."
- Right: "Cloning is plausible with insider access; commodity readers resist trivial duplication."

**❌ Spoilers in Neutral Phrasing**
- Wrong: "The foreman suspects the badge is cloned because of the retrofit accident."
- Right: "The scanner hesitates. The foreman studies your lapel."

**❌ Using technique in Neutral Phrasing**
- Wrong: "Set flag BADGE_CLONED to true if player has insider access."
- Right: "The reader blinks, then waits for the guard's nod."

**❌ Insufficient sources for posture**
- Wrong: Posture: corroborated, but only 1 source listed
- Right: Posture: corroborated requires multiple independent credible sources (2-5)

**❌ Missing Neutral Phrasing when not corroborated**
- Wrong: Posture: plausible, but no Neutral Phrasing provided
- Right: If posture is not "corroborated", must provide 1-3 neutral phrasing lines

**❌ Non-actionable Creative Implications**
- Wrong: "Plotwright: Think about gate options."
- Right: "Plotwright: allow insider route as loop-with-difference; otherwise enforce visual check"

**❌ Missing risk mitigations**
- Wrong: Risks listed, but no mitigations provided
- Right: For each risk, provide specific mitigation (tone, wording, placement)

**❌ Unchecked Done checklist at handoff**
- Wrong: Handing off with 2/6 items unchecked
- Right: All 6 items must be ticked before handoff

**❌ Question too broad**
- Wrong: "How do docks work?"
- Right: "Can a dock badge be cloned with off-the-shelf gear?" (smallest useful question)

**❌ Evidence without relevance summary**
- Wrong: "- https://example.com/whitepaper.pdf"
- Right: "- Trade whitepaper on RFID dock passes — common anti-clone features"

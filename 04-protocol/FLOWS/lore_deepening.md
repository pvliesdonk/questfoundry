# Lore Deepening Flow — Message Sequences

> **Status:** Normative — this document defines end-to-end message sequences for the Lore Deepening loop.

---

## 1. Overview

This specification defines the **message sequences** for the **Lore Deepening** loop: the protocol-level interactions that enable roles to transform accepted hooks into canonical lore with quality gates and traceability.

### Purpose

Lore Deepening transforms accepted hooks into canon by:
1. **Opening a TU** — Showrunner or Lore Weaver opens a Lore Deepening TU
2. **Drafting canon** — Lore Weaver creates Canon Pack with answers, timelines, constraints
3. **Pre-gate review** — Gatekeeper provides early risk assessment
4. **Merge request** — Canon Pack submitted for gatecheck and merge to Cold

### Design Principles

- **TU-bound** — ALL canon work MUST occur within a TU context
- **Schema-validated** — payloads validated against `tu_brief.schema.json` and `canon_pack.schema.json`
- **Pre-gate before merge** — Gatekeeper reviews before merge request
- **Explicit TU linkage** — Canon Packs MUST reference their TU
- **Spoiler separation** — Hot canon separate from player-safe summaries

---

## 2. Message Sequence: TU Open (Lore Deepening)

### 2.1 Context

**Trigger:** Showrunner or Lore Weaver initiates Lore Deepening session after Hook Harvest

**Participants:**
- **Showrunner (SR)** — Accountable owner (opens TU if coordinating multiple themes)
- **Lore Weaver (LW)** — Responsible owner (opens TU if focused session)
- **Consulted Roles** — RS (Researcher), PW (Plotwright), SS (Scene Smith), ST (Style Lead), GK (Gatekeeper)

### 2.2 Sequence

```
1. SR or LW → Broadcast: tu.open
   Intent: tu.open
   Payload: tu_brief (status: hot-proposed → stabilizing)
   Context: hot_cold="hot", tu=<new-TU-ID>, snapshot=<Cold snapshot>
   
2. Broadcast → SR/LW: ack
   Confirms TU opened and roles notified
```

### 2.3 Required Payload Fields (tu.open)

**Schema:** `03-schemas/tu_brief.schema.json`

**Required fields for Lore Deepening TU:**

```json
{
  "id": "TU-YYYY-MM-DD-LW<seq>",

  "responsible_r": ["LW"],
  "loop": "Lore Deepening",
  "slice": "Canonize hooks for <theme> (player-safe description)",

}
```

**Critical requirements:**
- `loop` MUST be `"Lore Deepening"`
- `responsible_r` MUST include `"LW"`
- `inputs` MUST reference accepted hooks from Hook Harvest
- `deliverables` MUST include Canon Pack
- **TU MUST be opened BEFORE any canon work begins** (traceability requirement)

```
1. LW drafts Canon Pack (internal work, no protocol message)
   
2. LW → GK: [Implicit pre-gate request via TU context]
   GK reviews Canon Pack for early risk assessment
   
3. GK → SR/LW: gate.submit (pre-gate report)
   Intent: gate.submit
   Payload: gatecheck_report (mode: "pre-gate")
   Flags likely risks before full gatecheck
   
4. LW addresses pre-gate feedback (if needed)
   
5. LW → SR: tu.submit_gate (ready for gatecheck)
   Intent: tu.submit_gate
   Payload: tu_brief (updated with deliverables)
   Signals Canon Pack ready for gatecheck
```

## 7. Complete Flow Example

### 7.1 Scenario: Kestrel Backstory Canonization

**Context:** After Hook Harvest accepted HK-20251028-03 (Kestrel jaw scar) and HK-20251028-04 (Dock 7 fire), Showrunner opens Lore Deepening TU for Lore Weaver to canonize.

**Sequence:**

```
Step 1: SR opens Lore Deepening TU
--------
SR → Broadcast: tu.open
  id: TU-2025-10-30-LW01
  loop: Lore Deepening
  responsible_r: [LW]
  inputs: [HK-20251028-03, HK-20251028-04]
  deliverables: [Canon Pack, player-safe summary, scene notes]

Step 2: LW drafts Canon Pack
--------
[Internal work — LW writes canon answers, timelines, constraints]
Canon Pack created with:
  - canon_answers_hot: Kestrel backstory, Dock 7 fire sabotage
  - timeline_anchors_hot: T0, T1, T2
  - player_safe_summary: (no spoilers)
  - downstream_effects: handoffs to PW, SS, ST, CC

Step 3: GK pre-gate review
--------
GK → SR/LW: gate.submit (pre-gate)
  mode: "pre-gate"
  notes: ["Risk: player-safe summary mentions 'sabotage' — spoiler"]
  decision: "conditional pass"

LW revises player-safe summary to remove spoiler

Step 4: LW submits merge request
--------
LW → SR: merge.request
  deliverables: [Canon Pack ready]
  bars_green: [Integrity]

Step 5: GK full gatecheck
--------
GK → SR: gate.decision (gate.pass)
  bars: [Integrity: green]
  decision: "pass"

Step 6: SR approves merge
--------
SR → Broadcast: merge.approve
  snapshot_context: "Cold @ 2025-10-30"
  linkage: Canon merged, hooks resolved

Step 7: SR closes TU
--------
SR → Broadcast: tu.close
  TU-2025-10-30-LW01 closed
```

## 8. Critical TU Requirement

### 8.1 TU Linkage is Mandatory

**Policy:** All artifacts destined for Cold MUST have a TU reference.

**For Lore Deepening:**
- Canon Packs MUST include `tu` field referencing the Lore Deepening TU
- Cannot merge canon without TU linkage
- Enables traceability: which hooks → which canon → which TU

**Error if missing:**

```json
{
  "code": "BUSINESS_RULE_VIOLATION",
  "message": "Cannot merge to Cold without TU linkage",
  "details": {
    "rule": "cold-bound-tu-requirement",
    "violation": "Canon Pack missing tu field",
    "remedy": "Add tu field to Canon Pack referencing Lore Deepening TU"
  }
}
```

### 8.2 TU Open Before Work

**Policy:** TU MUST be opened before canon work begins.

**Sequence enforcement:**
1. Hook Harvest accepts hook → hook.accept (owner_r: LW, loop: Lore Deepening)
2. **TU MUST be opened** → tu.open (loop: Lore Deepening)
3. LW drafts Canon Pack → (internal work)
4. LW submits for merge → merge.request

**Error if TU missing:**

```json
{
  "code": "BUSINESS_RULE_VIOLATION",
  "message": "Canon work started without TU context",
  "details": {
    "rule": "tu-before-canon",
    "violation": "Canon Pack created but no TU reference",
    "remedy": "Open Lore Deepening TU first, then link Canon Pack to TU"
  }
}
```

## 9. Handoffs from Lore Deepening

After Lore Deepening completes and canon merges to Cold, handoffs occur:

### 9.1 To Codex Expansion

**Content:** Player-safe summaries from Canon Pack

**Handoff:** `downstream_effects` → Codex Curator creates codex entries

**Message:** None required (informational handoff via Canon Pack)

### 9.2 To Scene Smith

**Content:** Scene callbacks, description updates

**Handoff:** `downstream_effects` → Scene Smith updates scenes

**Example:** "Add scar description to S12; callback in S41 (Ena reunion)"

### 9.3 To Plotwright

**Content:** Topology/gateway implications

**Handoff:** `downstream_effects` → Plotwright adjusts structure

**Example:** "Add gateway at Wormhole 3 for Syndicate confrontation"

### 9.4 To Style Lead

**Content:** Tone/voice guidance

**Handoff:** `downstream_effects` → Style Lead provides motif notes

**Example:** "Ensure scar described with heroic tone, not pity"

## 10. Error Conditions

| Error Code | Trigger | Example | Remedy |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|
| `VALIDATION_FAILED` | Canon Pack missing required fields | No `tu` field | Add TU reference |
| `BUSINESS_RULE_VIOLATION` | TU not opened before canon work | Canon Pack without TU | Open TU first |
| `BUSINESS_RULE_VIOLATION` | Merge without gatecheck | merge.request before gate.pass | Wait for gatecheck |
| `BUSINESS_RULE_VIOLATION` | Spoiler in player-safe summary | Player summary reveals sabotage | Remove spoiler, re-submit |
| `INVALID_STATE_TRANSITION` | merge.request from wrong state | TU not in gatecheck state | Follow sequence: stabilizing → gatecheck → merge |

## 11. Success Criteria

A Lore Deepening flow is successful when:
- ✅ TU opened BEFORE canon work begins (traceability)
- ✅ Canon Pack includes all required fields (tu, hooks_answered, canon_answers_hot, etc.)
- ✅ Pre-gate review completed with risks addressed
- ✅ Player-safe summary contains NO spoilers
- ✅ Downstream effects provide actionable handoffs (min 4)
- ✅ Gatecheck passes (Integrity bar green)
- ✅ Canon merged to Cold with updated snapshot reference
- ✅ TU closed with complete linkage documentation

## 13. Implementation Notes

### 13.1 Synchronous vs Asynchronous

Lore Deepening can be:
- **Synchronous** — real-time session with LW + consulted roles
- **Asynchronous** — LW drafts canon, shares for review, iterates
- **Hybrid** — async drafting + sync review meeting

All formats use same message protocol: `tu.open` → draft → `gate.submit` → `merge.request`

### 13.2 Researcher Integration

If Researcher role is awake:
- `research_posture_touched` should be `"corroborated"` or `"plausible"`
- Research memos referenced in `lineage`

If Researcher role is dormant:
- `research_posture_touched` may be `"uncorroborated:low/medium/high"`
- Canon Pack includes note about neutral phrasing for PN/Binder

### 13.3 Spoiler Separation

**Critical rule:** `canon_answers_hot` contains spoilers; `player_safe_summary` does NOT.

**Enforcement:**
- Pre-gate reviews `player_safe_summary` for spoiler leaks
- Gatecheck Integrity bar validates spoiler separation
- PN NEVER receives `canon_answers_hot` (Hot-only content)

### 13.4 Merge Mechanics

**What gets merged to Cold:**
- Canon Pack (Hot artifact) → Cold canon directory
- Player-safe summaries → handed to Codex Expansion (separate merge)
- TU Brief (updated with linkage) → Cold TU archive

**Snapshot update:**
- New Cold snapshot created: `Cold @ YYYY-MM-DD`
- All artifacts reference new snapshot ID
- Binder/PN use snapshot ID for reproducible exports

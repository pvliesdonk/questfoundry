# Gatecheck Flow — Message Sequences

> **Status:** Normative — this document defines end-to-end message sequences for Gatecheck and Merge handoffs.

---

## 1. Overview

This specification defines the **message sequences** for **Gatecheck** and **Merge** operations: the protocol-level interactions that enable Gatekeeper to validate quality bars, deliver decisions, and coordinate merge approvals with snapshot stamping per TRACEABILITY.

### Purpose

Gatecheck and Merge flows enable:
1. **Gate report submission** — Owners submit `gate.report.submit` with bar statuses
2. **Gate decision** — Gatekeeper responds with `gate.decision` (pass/conditional pass/block)
3. **Merge handoffs** — Smallest viable fixes with owner + TU assignments
4. **Merge approval** — Showrunner approves merge with snapshot stamping
5. **Merge rejection** — Gatekeeper blocks merge with remediation plan

### Design Principles

- **Bar-driven decisions** — gate decisions MUST tie to 8 quality bar statuses
- **Smallest viable fix** — yellow/red bars MUST specify minimal remediation
- **Owner accountability** — fixes MUST assign responsible owner role
- **TU linkage** — all handoffs MUST reference TU context
- **Snapshot stamping** — merge approvals MUST record Cold snapshot per TRACEABILITY
- **Player-safe reporting** — gate reports may contain spoilers (Hot-only) but follow spoiler hygiene

---

## 2. Message Sequence: Gate Report Submission

### 2.1 Context

**Trigger:** Owner completes work within TU and requests gatecheck OR Gatekeeper provides pre-gate feedback

**Participants:**
- **Owner (varies by loop)** — LW, CC, PW, SS, etc. — submits work for gatecheck
- **Gatekeeper (GK)** — Reviews quality bars, provides decision
- **Showrunner (SR)** — Accountable for merge coordination

### 2.2 Sequence

```
1. Owner → GK/SR: tu.submit_gate
   Intent: tu.submit_gate
   Payload: tu_brief (status: stabilizing → gatecheck)
   Signals work ready for gatecheck
   
2. GK reviews artifacts (internal work)
   Evaluates all 8 quality bars
   Determines bar statuses: green/yellow/red
   Identifies smallest viable fixes for yellow/red bars
   
3. GK → SR/Owner: gate.report.submit
   Intent: gate.report.submit
   Payload: gatecheck_report (mode: "pre-gate" or "gatecheck")
   
4. SR/Owner receives report and routes based on decision
```

### 2.3 Gate Report Structure

**Schema:** `03-schemas/gatecheck_report.schema.json`

**Required fields:**

```json
{
  "title": "TU-YYYY-MM-DD-<role><seq>",
  "checked": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "gatekeeper": "GK agent or human name",
  "scope": "Player-safe description of what was reviewed (10-240 chars)",
  "mode": "pre-gate|gatecheck",
  "cold_snapshot": "Cold @ YYYY-MM-DD",
  "artifacts_samples": [
    "Path or description of artifact 1",
    "Path or description of artifact 2"
  ],
  "decision": "pass|conditional pass|block",
  "why": "1-2 lines explaining decision tied to bar status (10-240 chars)",
  "next_actions": "Smallest viable fixes and responsible owners (10-400 chars)",
  "bars": [
    {
      "bar": "Integrity",
      "status": "green|yellow|red",
      "evidence": "Player-safe evidence supporting status (5-400 chars)",
      "smallest_viable_fix": "If yellow/red: minimal fix needed (5-400 chars)",
      "owner": "If yellow/red: responsible role (LW, CC, PW, etc.)",
      "notes": "Optional brief context (max 200 chars)"
    }
  ],
  "handoffs": [
    "Bar: <bar>; Fix: <description>; Owner: <role>; TU: <TU-ID>; Due: <date or window>"
  ],
  "checklist": [
    "✓ Decision tied to bar statuses",
    "✓ Smallest viable fixes specified for yellow/red bars",
    "✓ Responsible owners assigned",
    "✓ Player-safe constraint respected (if applicable)",
    "✓ Handoffs documented with TU linkage",
    "✓ TU trace updated"
  ]
}
```

**Critical requirements:**
- `bars` MUST include all 8 quality bars (Integrity, Reachability, Nonlinearity, Gateways, Style, Determinism, Presentation, Accessibility)
- Yellow/red bars MUST include `smallest_viable_fix` and `owner`
- `decision` MUST align with bar statuses:
  - `"pass"` — all bars green
  - `"conditional pass"` — at least one yellow bar, no red bars
  - `"block"` — at least one red bar
- `handoffs` MUST specify owner role + TU reference for yellow/red bars
- **Smallest viable fix** — minimal change to move bar from yellow/red to green

**Example gate report (conditional pass):**

```json

      "evidence": "Gateway conditions enforceable via knowledge ledger"
    },
    {
      "bar": "Style",
      "status": "yellow",
      "evidence": "Scar description in S12 uses clinical tone ('mandibular burn'); S41 uses heroic tone ('badge of honor')",
      "smallest_viable_fix": "Scene Smith to revise S12 scar description to match heroic tone from S41",
      "owner": "SS",
      "notes": "Style Lead to provide motif guidance for scars/wounds"
    },
    {
      "bar": "Determinism",

      "evidence": "Not applicable for canon/prose updates"
    },
    {
      "bar": "Presentation",
      "status": "green",
      "evidence": "Player-safe summary contains no spoilers; sabotage detail masked"
    },
    {
      "bar": "Accessibility",
      "status": "green",
      "evidence": "Reading level appropriate; alt guidance not required for canon text"
    }
  ],
  "handoffs": [
    "Bar: Style; Fix: Revise S12 scar description to heroic tone; Owner: SS; TU: TU-2025-10-30-LW01; Due: before next export",
    "Bar: Style; Fix: Provide motif guidance for scars; Owner: ST; TU: TU-2025-10-30-LW01; Due: immediate"
  ],
  "checklist": [
    "✓ Decision (conditional pass) tied to bar statuses (Style yellow)",
    "✓ Smallest viable fix specified (S12 tone revision)",
    "✓ Responsible owners assigned (SS, ST)",
    "✓ Player-safe constraint respected in report",
    "✓ Handoffs documented with TU linkage",
    "✓ TU trace updated with gate decision"
  ]
}
```

## 3. Message Sequence: Gate Decision

### 3.1 Context

**Trigger:** Gatekeeper completes bar evaluation and determines decision

**Participants:**
- **Gatekeeper (GK)** — Delivers gate decision
- **Showrunner (SR)** — Receives decision, coordinates next steps
- **Owner (varies)** — Receives feedback, addresses fixes if needed

### 3.2 Decision Types

#### 3.2.1 Gate Pass (`gate.pass`)

**Condition:** All 8 bars green

**Intent:** `gate.pass`

**Payload:** `gatecheck_report` (decision: "pass")

**Outcome:** Work ready for merge; SR can approve immediately

**Sequence:**
```
1. GK → SR: gate.pass
   All bars green; no blockers
   
2. SR → Broadcast: merge.approve
   (see §4 for merge approval sequence)
```

#### 3.2.2 Gate Conditional Pass (`gate.conditional_pass`)

**Condition:** At least one yellow bar, no red bars

**Intent:** `gate.conditional_pass`

**Payload:** `gatecheck_report` (decision: "conditional pass")

**Outcome:** Work can merge with handoffs for yellow bar fixes

**Sequence:**
```
1. GK → SR: gate.conditional_pass
   Yellow bars with smallest viable fixes specified
   
2. SR evaluates:
   a) If fixes can be deferred post-merge → merge.approve + handoffs
   b) If fixes must precede merge → Owner addresses, re-submits
   
3a. Deferred path:
    SR → Broadcast: merge.approve (with handoff TUs created)
    
3b. Pre-merge path:
    SR → Owner: tu.rework (address yellow bars)
    Owner addresses fixes
    Owner → GK: tu.submit_gate (re-submit)
    Return to step 1
```

#### 3.2.3 Gate Block (`gate.block`)

**Condition:** At least one red bar

**Intent:** `gate.block`

**Payload:** `gatecheck_report` (decision: "block")

**Outcome:** Work CANNOT merge; owner must address red bars

**Sequence:**
```
1. GK → SR/Owner: gate.block
   Red bars with smallest viable fixes specified
   
2. Owner addresses red bar fixes
   
3. Owner → GK: tu.submit_gate (re-submit)
   
4. Return to gate report submission (§2)
```

## 4. Message Sequence: Merge Request and Approval

### 4.1 Context

**Trigger:** Gate pass or gate conditional pass received; owner requests merge

   - All blockers resolved
   - TU deliverables complete
   
3a. If approved:
    SR → Broadcast: merge.approve
    Intent: merge.approve
    Payload: tu_brief (status: merge-requested → cold-merged)
    Snapshot stamping: "Cold @ YYYY-MM-DD" recorded per TRACEABILITY
    
3b. If rejected:
    SR → Owner: merge.reject

    Payload: rationale for rejection
    Owner addresses issues, returns to step 1
```

      ],
      "bars_green": ["Presentation", "Integrity", "Style", "Accessibility"],
      "gatecheck": "Gate decision: pass (all bars green)",
      "linkage": "Canon Pack TU-2025-10-30-LW01; codex merged to Cold; handoffs to Binder/PN"
    }
  },
  "refs": ["TU-2025-10-30-CC01"]
}
```

### 4.4 Merge Approve Message

**Intent:** `merge.approve`

**Sender:** SR

**Receiver:** Broadcast

**Payload:** `tu_brief.schema.json` (final, with snapshot stamping)

**Required fields:**

```json
{
  "id": "TU-YYYY-MM-DD-<role><seq>",
  "snapshot_context": "Cold @ YYYY-MM-DD",  // TRACEABILITY: snapshot stamping
  "linkage": "Artifacts merged to Cold @ YYYY-MM-DD; TU closed; handoffs complete"
}
```

**Critical requirement:** `snapshot_context` MUST be updated to new Cold snapshot per TRACEABILITY

**Example message:**

```json
{
  "protocol": { "name": "qf-protocol", "version": "1.0.0" },
  "id": "urn:uuid:jkl012...",
  "time": "2025-10-30T20:10:00Z",

  "receiver": { "role": "broadcast" },
  "intent": "merge.approve",
  "context": {
    "hot_cold": "cold",  // Now Cold after merge
    "tu": "TU-2025-10-30-CC01",
    "snapshot": "Cold @ 2025-10-30",  // Snapshot stamping per TRACEABILITY
    "loop": "Codex Expansion"
  },
  "safety": { "player_safe": true, "spoilers": "forbidden" },
  "payload": {
    "type": "tu_brief",
    "$schema": "../03-schemas/tu_brief.schema.json",
    "data": {

}
```

### 4.5 Merge Reject Message

**Intent:** `merge.reject`

**Sender:** SR or GK

**Receiver:** Owner

**Payload:** Rationale for rejection (simple text or structured)

**Common reasons:**
- Gate decision was block (red bars)
- Deliverables incomplete
- TU linkage missing
- Merge conflicts with other Hot work

**Example message:**

```json

## 5. Complete Flow Example

### 5.1 Scenario: Topology Gatecheck with Conditional Pass

**Context:** Plotwright completes topology update (TU-2025-10-30-PW02), submits for gatecheck. Gatekeeper finds Style bar at yellow, approves conditional pass with handoff.

**Sequence:**

```
Step 1: PW submits for gatecheck
--------
PW → GK/SR: tu.submit_gate
  id: TU-2025-10-30-PW02
  deliverables: [Topology update: Docking Bay hub, Gateway logic documented]

Step 2: GK evaluates bars
--------
[Internal work — GK reviews topology, choices, gateway logic]
Bar statuses:
  - Integrity: green (all references resolve)
  - Reachability: green (keystone beats reachable)
  - Nonlinearity: green (hub design intentional)
  - Gateways: green (conditions enforceable)
  - Style: yellow (choice text tone inconsistent in Section 17)
  - Determinism: green (N/A for topology)
  - Presentation: green (no spoilers in choices)
  - Accessibility: green (navigation clear)

Step 3: GK delivers conditional pass
--------
GK → SR: gate.conditional_pass
  decision: "conditional pass"
  why: "Style bar at yellow: Section 17 choice text tone inconsistent"
  bars: [Style: yellow]
  handoffs: [
    "Bar: Style; Fix: Revise Section 17 choice text to match hub tone; Owner: SS; TU: TU-2025-10-30-PW02; Due: before next export"
  ]

Step 4: SR evaluates handoff
--------
SR decision: yellow bar fix can be deferred post-merge
SR creates follow-up TU for Scene Smith: TU-2025-10-31-SS01

Step 5: PW requests merge
--------
PW → SR: merge.request
  deliverables: [Topology update complete]
  gatecheck: "Gate decision: conditional pass (Style yellow, deferred)"

Step 6: SR approves merge with snapshot stamping
--------
SR → Broadcast: merge.approve
  snapshot_context: "Cold @ 2025-10-30"  // Snapshot stamping per TRACEABILITY
  linkage: Topology merged; handoff to SS for Section 17 fix

Step 7: SR notifies Scene Smith
--------
SR → SS: tu.open (TU-2025-10-31-SS01)
  loop: "Style Tune-up"
  inputs: [Section 17 choice text fix per gate handoff]
  deliverables: [Revised Section 17 text matching hub tone]
```

## 6. Smallest Viable Fix Principle

### 6.1 Definition

**Smallest Viable Fix:** The minimal change required to move a quality bar from yellow/red to green.

**Characteristics:**
- **Minimal scope** — change as few lines/artifacts as possible
- **Focused on bar** — directly addresses the bar failure, not tangential issues
- **Actionable** — clear what to do, who does it, where it happens
- **Testable** — can verify fix moves bar to green

### 6.2 Examples

| Bar | Status | Evidence | Smallest Viable Fix | NOT Smallest Fix |
|-----|--------|----------|---------------------|------------------|
| Integrity | Red | Section 42 reference unresolved | Create Section 42 stub OR retarget to Section 41 | Rewrite entire hub structure |
| Style | Yellow | Section 17 tone inconsistent | Revise Section 17 choice text to match hub tone | Rewrite all hub sections for consistency |
| Presentation | Red | Codex entry reveals spoiler | Mask spoiler phrase with neutral phrasing | Rewrite entire codex entry |
| Reachability | Red | Keystone beat unreachable | Add second path to keystone OR remove blocking condition | Redesign entire topology |

### 6.3 Owner Assignment

**Smallest viable fix MUST assign responsible owner role:**

- **Integrity, Reachability, Nonlinearity, Gateways** → PW (Plotwright) or SS (Scene Smith)
- **Style** → ST (Style Lead) or SS (Scene Smith)
- **Presentation** → CC (Codex Curator), LW (Lore Weaver), or SS (Scene Smith)
- **Accessibility** → BB (Binder) or role that created artifact
- **Determinism** → AD (Art Director), AuD (Audio Director), IL (Illustrator), AuP (Audio Producer)

**Handoff format:**
> "Bar: <bar>; Fix: <smallest viable fix>; Owner: <role>; TU: <TU-ID>; Due: <date or window>"

---

## 7. Snapshot Stamping per TRACEABILITY

### 7.1 Requirement

**TRACEABILITY policy:** Merge approvals MUST record Cold snapshot ID.

**Format:** `"Cold @ YYYY-MM-DD"` or equivalent timestamp/commit/tag reference

**Location:** `tu_brief.snapshot_context` field updated in `merge.approve` message

### 7.2 Usage

**Binder exports:**
- Record Cold snapshot ID for reproducibility
- List TU-IDs included since last export

**PN dry-runs:**
- Cite Cold snapshot ID for consistent play experience
- Ensure codex/canon aligned with snapshot

**Codex entries:**
- Include `snapshot` field referencing merge snapshot
- Enable provenance tracking

### 7.3 Example

**Before merge:**
```json
{
  "id": "TU-2025-10-30-CC01",
  "snapshot_context": "Cold @ 2025-10-28"  // Old snapshot
}
```

**After merge (snapshot stamping):**
```json
{
  "id": "TU-2025-10-30-CC01",
  "snapshot_context": "Cold @ 2025-10-30"  // New snapshot stamped
}
```

## 8. Bar Status Taxonomy

### 8.1 Status Levels

| Status | Meaning | Merge Impact | Fix Required |
|--------|---------|--------------|--------------|
| **Green** | Bar passes; no issues | No blocker | No |
| **Yellow** | Bar caution; non-critical issue | Can merge with handoff | Yes (can defer post-merge) |
| **Red** | Bar failure; critical issue | BLOCKS merge | Yes (must fix before merge) |

### 8.2 Decision Mapping

| Bar Statuses | Gate Decision | Merge Allowed? | Next Action |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| All green | `pass` | Yes (immediate) | merge.approve |
| ≥1 yellow, no red | `conditional pass` | Yes (with handoffs) | merge.approve + create follow-up TUs |
| ≥1 red | `block` | No | Owner addresses red bars, re-submits |

### 8.3 Bar Evaluation Order

**Recommended order for Gatekeeper evaluation:**

1. **Integrity** — foundational (references must resolve)
2. **Reachability** — critical beats must be reachable
3. **Presentation** — spoiler hygiene critical for player-safe surfaces
4. **Gateways** — gateway logic must be enforceable
5. **Nonlinearity** — hubs/loops must be intentional
6. **Style** — tone/voice consistency
7. **Accessibility** — navigation and sensory considerations
8. **Determinism** — asset reproducibility (when applicable)

## 9. Handoff Coordination

### 9.1 Handoff Structure

**Format:**
> "Bar: <bar>; Fix: <smallest viable fix>; Owner: <role>; TU: <TU-ID>; Due: <date or window>"

**Example:**
> "Bar: Style; Fix: Revise Section 17 choice text to match hub tone; Owner: SS; TU: TU-2025-10-30-PW02; Due: before next export"

### 9.2 Handoff Tracking

**Showrunner responsibilities:**
- Create follow-up TUs for yellow bar fixes
- Assign owners and due dates
- Track handoff completion
- Link handoff TUs to original gate report TU

**Example follow-up TU:**

```json
{
  "id": "TU-2025-10-31-SS01",
  "opened": "2025-10-31",
  "owner_a": "SR",
  "responsible_r": ["SS"],
  "loop": "Style Tune-up",
  "slice": "Fix Section 17 choice text tone per gate handoff",
  "snapshot_context": "Cold @ 2025-10-30",
  "inputs": [
    "Gate handoff from TU-2025-10-30-PW02",
    "Section 17 current text",
    "Hub tone reference (Docking Bay hub)"
  ],
  "deliverables": [
    "Revised Section 17 choice text matching hub tone"
  ],
  "bars_green": ["Style"],
  "linkage": "Gate handoff from TU-2025-10-30-PW02; addresses yellow Style bar"
}
```

### 9.3 Handoff Completion

**Sequence:**
```
1. Owner completes handoff fix within follow-up TU
   
2. Owner → SR: tu.submit_gate (follow-up TU ready)
   
3. GK validates fix moves bar to green
   
4. GK → SR: gate.pass (follow-up TU)
   
5. SR closes follow-up TU
   SR updates original TU linkage: handoff complete
```

## 10. Error Conditions

| Error Code | Trigger | Example | Remedy |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|
| `VALIDATION_FAILED` | Gate report missing required fields | No `bars` array | Add all 8 bars to report |
| `BUSINESS_RULE_VIOLATION` | Decision doesn't match bar statuses | Decision "pass" but Style bar yellow | Align decision with bar statuses |
| `BUSINESS_RULE_VIOLATION` | Yellow/red bar missing fix or owner | Style yellow, no `smallest_viable_fix` | Add fix and owner for yellow/red bars |
| `BUSINESS_RULE_VIOLATION` | Merge request before gate pass | merge.request before gate.pass | Wait for gate decision |
| `BUSINESS_RULE_VIOLATION` | Merge approve without snapshot stamping | `snapshot_context` not updated | Record new Cold snapshot per TRACEABILITY |
| `NOT_AUTHORIZED` | Non-GK sends gate decision | PW sends gate.pass | Only GK can deliver gate decisions |
| `NOT_AUTHORIZED` | Non-SR approves merge | LW sends merge.approve | Only SR can approve merges |

---

## 11. Success Criteria

A Gatecheck and Merge flow is successful when:
- ✅ All 8 quality bars evaluated with statuses (green/yellow/red)
- ✅ Gate decision ties to bar statuses (pass: all green; conditional pass: ≥1 yellow, no red; block: ≥1 red)
- ✅ Yellow/red bars have smallest viable fixes specified
- ✅ Responsible owners assigned for yellow/red bars
- ✅ Handoffs documented with owner + TU + due date
- ✅ Merge approval includes snapshot stamping per TRACEABILITY
- ✅ Follow-up TUs created for deferred yellow bar fixes
- ✅ TU linkage complete (original TU → handoff TUs → completion)

## 13. Implementation Notes

### 13.1 Pre-Gate vs Full Gatecheck

**Pre-gate (`mode: "pre-gate"`):**
- Early risk assessment during stabilization
- Informal feedback loop
- Identifies likely blockers before full gatecheck
- Does not trigger merge approval

**Full gatecheck (`mode: "gatecheck"`):**
- Formal gate decision with all 8 bars evaluated
- Triggers merge approval (if pass or conditional pass)
- Blocks merge (if block)
- Recorded in TU trace for provenance

### 13.2 Bar Applicability

Not all bars apply to all artifact types:

| Artifact Type | Critical Bars | Optional/N/A Bars |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Canon Pack | Integrity, Presentation | Determinism, Accessibility |
| Codex Entry | Presentation, Integrity, Style | Reachability, Gateways, Determinism |
| Topology | Integrity, Reachability, Nonlinearity, Gateways | Determinism |
| Art/Audio Plan | Determinism, Style | Reachability, Gateways |
| Translation | Style, Accessibility, Presentation | Reachability, Gateways |

**Gatekeeper judgment:** Mark non-applicable bars as green with note "N/A for <artifact type>"

### 13.3 Conditional Pass Merge Timing

**Showrunner decision for conditional pass:**

**Immediate merge** (yellow bar fix deferred post-merge):
- Fix does not block player value
- Fix can be isolated in follow-up TU
- Risk of deferral is low (e.g., style polish, link stub creation)

**Pre-merge fix** (yellow bar fix before merge):
- Fix affects critical player experience
- Fix interdependent with other Hot work
- Risk of deferral is high (e.g., spoiler hint, near-miss reference)

**Default:** Defer post-merge unless owner or GK requests pre-merge fix.

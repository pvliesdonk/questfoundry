Title: Spec: Lifecycles — Gate and View/Export (Cold/PN-safe)

Summary
- Define gatecheck decisioning and view/export lifecycle, enforcing PN Cold-only and player-safe constraints.

Tasks
- Add `04-protocol/LIFECYCLES/gate.md`:
  - pre-gate → gatecheck decision (`pass | conditional pass | block`)
  - For each: bar evidence, smallest viable fix, owner, handoffs; map to schema fields.
- Add `04-protocol/LIFECYCLES/view.md`:
  - snapshot selected → export → PN dry-run → feedback
  - PN must only receive `cold` + `player_safe: true` payloads; require `context.snapshot`.

Acceptance Criteria
- Gate doc ties decisions to Quality Bars and `gatecheck_report` fields.
- View doc requires `context.snapshot` in envelope; errors defined for missing/invalid snapshot.
- PN boundary rules explicit.

- Check schema fields referenced exist and match enums.

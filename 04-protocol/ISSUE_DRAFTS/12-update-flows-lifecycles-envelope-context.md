Title: Update FLOWS/LIFECYCLES with envelope context and PN safety gates

Summary
- Update flow and lifecycle docs to include envelope context fields and PN safety gates explicitly where messages are shown.

Tasks
- In `04-protocol/FLOWS/*.md` and `04-protocol/LIFECYCLES/*.md`:
  - Add a short “Envelope overlay” section for each sequence showing `context.hot_cold`, `context.snapshot`, `safety.player_safe`, and `payload.type` expectations at each step.
  - For PN-related steps, add a callout that `receiver.role = PN` enforces `cold` + `player_safe: true` per schema.
- Where merges are shown, add a callout to include `context.tu` and record `context.snapshot` in `merge.approve` reply.

Acceptance Criteria
- Each flow/lifecycle doc shows envelope context and safety expectations inline with the sequence.
- PN gate enforcement is explicitly documented and matches schema.
- Merge steps consistently mention TU and snapshot stamping.

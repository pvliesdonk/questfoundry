Title: Spec: FLOWS — Hook Harvest and Lore Deepening

Summary
- Author end-to-end message sequences for two core loops: Hook Harvest and Lore Deepening.

Tasks
- Add `04-protocol/FLOWS/hook_harvest.md`:
  - Sequence: `hook.create*` → SR triage → `hook.update_status (accepted|deferred|rejected)`.
  - Note required fields for acceptance (owner, next loop) and deferral (reason, revisit).
- Add `04-protocol/FLOWS/lore_deepening.md`:
  - Sequence: SR→LW `tu.open` → LW submits canon payload → GK pre-gate → `merge.request`.
  - Document TU requirement prior to merge.

Acceptance Criteria
- Sequences list intents, roles, and expected replies.
- Payloads are backed by Layer 3 schemas (hook_card, tu_brief, canon_pack).
- TU linkage is explicit before merge.

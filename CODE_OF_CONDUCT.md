# QuestFoundry Code of Conduct

QuestFoundry is a collaborative studio space. We build strange, delightful, nonlinear books—without making the people involved feel strange or unsafe. This document sets expectations for behavior in all project spaces (issues, PRs, discussions, chats, events).

---

## Our pledge

We pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

---

## Our standards

**Be excellent to each other**

- Be respectful. Disagree with ideas without attacking people.
- Be specific and constructive. Proposals beat put-downs.
- Credit sources. Cite influences and prior work.
- Keep spoilers clearly marked in Hot; never put them on player surfaces.

**Unacceptable behavior**

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks.
- Doxing, threats, or sustained disruption.
- Sexualized language or imagery; unwelcome advances.
- Trolling, insults, or “gotcha” reviews.
- Sharing private communications without consent.
- Repeatedly ignoring maintainers’ guidance on scope, spoilers, or safety.

## Scope

This Code applies in all project spaces and when an individual is representing the project in public. It includes repositories, issues, PRs, discussions, chats, meetings, and community events.

---

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

- **Email:** <conduct@questfoundry.example> (or contact a maintainer privately)
- **Private issue:** open a ticket titled “Conduct (private)” with minimal details; a maintainer will move it to a confidential channel.

Provide as much detail as possible: what happened, where, when, who was involved, and whether you feel safe for follow-up.

We will respect requests for confidentiality. Retaliation against reporters is itself a violation of this Code.

---

## Enforcement

Maintainers will review all reports promptly and fairly. Actions may include:

1. Clarification or private warning  
2. Temporary or permanent restrictions (issues/PRs/discussions)  
3. Temporary or permanent removal from the community  
4. Escalation to hosting platforms or, if necessary, relevant authorities

Enforcement decisions are made by the maintainer team acting as **Showrunner** (triage) and **Gatekeeper** (standards). When feasible, we will share a brief summary of actions taken with the reporter.

---

## Guidelines for reviewers

- Focus on the work, not the worker.  
- Request **small, testable** changes.  
- Call out spoilers or safety issues immediately.  
- If a thread heats up, pause and invite a maintainer.  
- When in doubt, move complex disputes to an ADR discussion rather than litigating in a PR.

---

## Appeals

If you believe an enforcement action was made in error or without proper context, you may appeal by emailing the maintainers with new information. Appeals are reviewed by maintainers not involved in the original action whenever possible.

---

## Attribution

This Code is informed by common open-source community standards and adapted for QuestFoundry’s layered workflow and spoiler-safety norms.

---

**TL;DR**  
Be kind. Be specific. Keep spoilers contained. If something goes wrong, tell us and we’ll fix it.

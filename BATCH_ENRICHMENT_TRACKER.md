# Batch Enrichment Tracker (Tiers 2-5)

## New Inconsistencies Found

### Issue #14: Research Posture Format in canon_pack.md
**Location:** canon_pack.md line 24
**Current:** `uncorroborated:<low|med|high>`
**Should be:** `uncorroborated:low | uncorroborated:medium | uncorroborated:high`
**Why:** Taxonomy uses "medium" not "med"; separate values not nested format

## Pattern Applied to All

Each enriched template includes:
1. HTML constraint comments (type, required, format, taxonomy §refs)
2. All Phase 2+3 corrections (13 types, 7 status, 8 bars, 13 loops, space deferrals)
3. Validation rules (field, cross-field, cross-artifact)
4. Common errors section (4-10 examples)
5. Field reference table
6. Layer 2 references

## Issues Found During Tier 2-5 Enrichment

### Issue #14: Research Posture Format (Expanded)
**Templates affected:** canon_pack.md, codex_entry.md, research_memo.md
**Problems:**
- Uses "med" instead of "medium" (abbreviation not allowed)
- Uses nested format `uncorroborated:<low|med|high>` instead of flat format
**Resolution:** Use flat format with full word: `uncorroborated:low | uncorroborated:medium | uncorroborated:high`
**Status:** Fixed in all 3 enriched templates; documented in LAYER1_CORRECTIONS.md

### Tiers 1-5: No additional issues found
All 17 enriched templates completed with no new inconsistencies discovered beyond Issue #14.

## PHASE 3 COMPLETION STATUS: ✅ 100%

**Total artifacts enriched:** 17/17 (100%)
- Tier 1 (Core Workflow): 3/3 ✅
- Tier 2 (Content Creation): 4/4 ✅
- Tier 3 (Asset Planning): 4/4 ✅
- Tier 4 (Localization & Export): 4/4 ✅
- Tier 5 (Operational): 2/2 ✅

**Total issues found:** 14 (all documented in LAYER1_CORRECTIONS.md)
- 7 from Phase 2 (field registry extraction)
- 7 from Phase 3 (template enrichment)

**Methodology proven:** Systematic enrichment with HTML constraint comments, validation rules, common errors, and field references enables future Layer 3 schema generation while maintaining human readability.

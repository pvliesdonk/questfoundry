# Targeted Loops — Index & Chooser

Targeted loops are **short, goal-driven passes** that change **Hot** and only reach **Cold** after Gatekeeper checks. Pick one, run it, hand off cleanly, repeat. This page is your map.

---

## Quick chooser (use-when → outcome)

| Loop | Use when… | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| **Story Spark** | You need to add/reshape plot topology (hubs, loops, gateways) and seed drafts. | Topology delta + section briefs & draft prose + fresh hooks. |
| **Hook Harvest** | You’ve got scattered hooks from drafting/research and need order. | Harvest Sheet: accepted/deferred/rejected hooks with owners & next loops. |
| **Lore Deepening** | Accepted hooks must become **canon** (backstory, timeline, causality). | Canon Pack + notes to Plotwright/Scene + player-safe summaries for Codex. |
| **Codex Expansion** | Players need terms explained; new canon landed. | Player-safe Codex Pack + crosslink map; no spoilers. |
| **Style Tune-up** | Voice/register/motif drift is visible. | Style Addendum + edit notes + pre-gate on Style/Presentation. |
| **Art Touch-up** | You want illustration **plans** and maybe renders. | Art Plan (+ optional renders & determinism logs) ready to merge or defer. |
| **Audio Pass** | You want sound **plans** and maybe assets. | Audio Plan (+ optional assets & reproducibility notes) ready to merge or defer. |
| **Translation Pass** | A language slice is needed (glossary or full surfaces). | Language Pack with glossary, register map, localized surfaces, coverage %. |
| **Binding Run** | You must ship a **view** on Cold (MD/HTML/EPUB/PDF). | Export bundle stamped with snapshot ID + View Log. |
| **Narration Dry-Run** | PN should playtest the current view in-world. | PN playtest notes → small follow-ups (style/codex/binder). |

## Loop summaries (one-pagers)

### Story Spark

- **Goal**: meaningful nonlinearity (hubs/loops/gateways) with legible choices.
- **Deliver**: topology delta; briefs; draft prose; hook list; pre-gate notes.
- **Hand-off**: Hook Harvest → Lore Deepening → Style/Codex as needed.

### Hook Harvest

- **Goal**: collect, cluster, triage hooks (narrative/scene/factual/taxonomy).
- **Deliver**: Harvest Sheet (accepted/deferred/rejected, owners, next loop).
- **Hand-off**: Lore Deepening / Story Spark / Codex / Style.

### Lore Deepening

- **Goal**: turn accepted hooks into spoiler-level **canon**.
- **Deliver**: Canon Pack (answers, timeline, constraints) + player-safe summaries.
- **Hand-off**: Codex Expansion (summaries), Story Spark (topology notes), Scene Smith (prose notes).

### Codex Expansion

- **Goal**: player-safe comprehension, not revelation.
- **Deliver**: entries (Overview/Usage/Context/See-also/Notes) + crosslinks.
- **Hand-off**: Binder (for export), Translator (glossary seeds).

### Style Tune-up

- **Goal**: correct voice/register/motif drift without changing structure.
- **Deliver**: Style Addendum + targeted edit notes + pre-gate.
- **Hand-off**: Owners apply edits; Binder/PN/Translator informed if surfaces changed.

### Art Touch-up

- **Goal**: decide **what** to illustrate and **why**; optionally render.
- **Deliver**: Art Plan (subject, purpose, composition, caption, constraints, alt guidance) + optional renders & determinism logs.
- **Hand-off**: Binder (inclusion options), Style (caption tone).

### Audio Pass

- **Goal**: decide **what** to hear and **why**; optionally produce assets.
- **Deliver**: Audio Plan (cue, placement, intensity, captions, safety) + optional assets & reproducibility notes.
- **Hand-off**: Binder (inclusion), Style/Translator (phrasing & VO).

### Translation Pass

- **Goal**: build a target-language slice.
- **Deliver**: Language Pack (glossary, register map, motif equivalence, idiom strategy, localized surfaces, coverage %, open issues).
- **Hand-off**: Binder; Style (register); PN (gate phrasing).

### Binding Run

- **Goal**: assemble a **player-safe export** from a **Cold snapshot**.
- **Deliver**: bundle (MD/HTML/EPUB/PDF) + front matter (snapshot/options) + View Log.
- **Hand-off**: PN for a **Narration Dry-Run**.

### Narration Dry-Run

- **Goal**: PN plays the view in-voice to spot UX issues.
- **Deliver**: PN playtest notes tagged (`choice-ambiguity`, `gate-friction`, `nav-bug`, etc.).
- **Hand-off**: Style/Codex/Binder; very rarely Story Spark if topology truly at fault.

## Guardrails that apply to every loop

- **Hot vs Cold**: work in Hot; merge to Cold only after **Gatekeeper** passes **Quality Bars**.
- **Player surfaces**: follow **SPOILER_HYGIENE.md** and **ACCESSIBILITY_AND_CONTENT_NOTES.md**.
- **Traceability**: each loop run sits inside a **Trace Unit (TU)**; record inputs/outputs and bar pressure.
- **Dormancy**: Showrunner decides whether Researcher/Art/Audio/Translator are awake; plan-only merges as **deferred** are allowed.

## Typical micro-routes (copy & run)

- **Story slice** → Spark → Harvest → Lore → Codex → Gatecheck → Merge → Bind → PN  
- **Style fix** → Style Tune-up → Owners edit → Gatecheck → Merge  
- **Art plan-only** → Art Touch-up (plan) → Gatecheck → Merge (deferred:art) → Bind  
- **Translation slice** → Translation Pass → Gatecheck → Merge → Bind (coverage flagged)

**TL;DR**  
Pick one loop, do one job, hand it off. Small, clean passes beat grand gestures.

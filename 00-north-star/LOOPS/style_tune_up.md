# Style Tune-up — Correct Drift in Voice, Register, and Aesthetic Guardrails

**Purpose**  
Detect and correct **style drift** across prose, captions, and PN surfaces without re-architecting the story. Tighten voice, register, motifs, and visual guardrails so the book reads like one mind made it.

**Outcome**  
A consolidated **style addendum** with specific edit notes to owners, plus a green **Presentation/Style** pre-gate—ready for merge after downstream fixes.

---

## 1) Triggers (Showrunner)

- Readers/PN report tonal wobble or inconsistent diction.
- New chapter/act introduces a variant tone that needs harmonizing.
- Art/Audio plans landed and nudge aesthetics.
- Localization uncovered phrasing that fights register.

**Activation**  
Open/attach a **Trace Unit (TU)**: `tu-style-tune-<scope>`.

---

## 2) Inputs

- Current **Cold** style guide (+ motifs & exemplars).
- Recent prose drafts (Hot), captions, PN lines.
- Canon changes that might affect tone (grim vs caper).
- PN and Binder UX notes; localization notes (if any).

---

## 3) Roles & Responsibilities

- **Style Lead (R)**  
  - Diagnose drift; author **style addendum**; write targeted edit notes.
- **Scene Smith (C)**  
  - Receive edits; propose rewrites that preserve intent.
- **Plotwright (C)**  
  - Confirm revisions don’t alter topology/gateways.
- **Art Director / Audio Director (C, optional)**  
  - Align captions/cue language with register.
- **Translator (C, optional)**  
  - Flag untranslatable idioms; suggest equivalents.
- **Gatekeeper (C)**  
  - Pre-check Style & Presentation Safety.
- **Showrunner (A)**  
  - Scope pass; sequence fixes.

---

## 4) Procedure

1. **Drift Diagnosis (Style Lead)**  
   - Sample sections (early/middle/late), PN lines, and recent captions.  
   - Tag issues: `voice-shift`, `register-mismatch`, `motif-missing`, `over-exposition`, `jargon-spike`.

2. **Exemplar Pass**  
   - Provide short **before/after** exemplars for each issue (human prose).  
   - Reaffirm motif kit (e.g., “shadow-side neon”, “low-G dust”, “relay hum”).

3. **Style Addendum**  
   - Add rules or clarifications: sentence rhythm under pressure, idiom boundaries, POV distance, caption tone.  
   - Localization notes: avoid puns / provide alternatives.

4. **Edit Notes to Owners**  
   - Annotated list: `file/section → issue → fix suggestion (1–2 lines)`  
   - PN phrase bank updates if needed (diegetic checks phrasing).

5. **Owner Revisions (Scene/PN/Art/Audio)**  
   - Make minimal changes to hit style; escalate if structure might change.

6. **Pre-Gate (Gatekeeper)**  
   - Style & Presentation Safety check; ensure no spoilers snuck into captions/PN.

7. **Package**  
   - Bundle **style addendum** + **edit notes** + **pre-gate note** into the TU.

---

## 5) Deliverables (Hot)

- **Style Addendum** (human text): rules, motif kit, exemplar snippets.
- **Edit Notes**: targeted fix list by section/caption/PN line.
- **Phrase Bank** (optional): PN diegetic gate phrasing patterns.
- **Pre-gate note**: Style/Presentation status and any residual risks.

---

## 6) Merge Path (summary)

- After owners apply edits and **Gatekeeper** passes **Style + Presentation**, **Showrunner** merges the **Style Addendum** (and updated surfaces) to **Cold**.

---

## 7) Success Criteria

- Prose and PN read in a consistent **register**; motifs reappear intentionally.
- Captions and cue sheets align with voice; no technique-talk on surfaces.
- Localization pitfalls are noted with alternatives.
- Gatekeeper reports **Style/Presentation** green.

---

## 8) Failure Modes & Remedies

- **Overcorrection flattens character voice** → Keep character idiolect; harmonize narration only.  
- **Style change implies story change** → Route to **Story Spark**; don’t smuggle structure via style.  
- **Caption spoilers** → Move detail to canon notes; rewrite caption atmospheric.  
- **Untranslatable idioms** → Provide neutral phrasing or region-appropriate equivalents.

## 9) RACI (quick)

| Task | R | A | C | I |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Diagnose & addendum | Style Lead | Showrunner | Scene, PN, Art/Audio, Translator | Gatekeeper |
| Apply edits | Content owners | Showrunner | Style Lead | Gatekeeper |
| Pre-gate | Gatekeeper | Showrunner | Style Lead | All |
| Merge | Showrunner | Showrunner | Gatekeeper | All |

## 10) Mini Exemplar (pattern)

**Before**: “In low gravity, you are floating, which is disorienting, and the alarms are very loud.”  
**After** (house register tight): “Low-G lifts you an inch; the floor forgets you. Alarms chew the corridor.”

Motifs: `low-G`, `industrial noise`. Rhythm: shorter under pressure.

---

**TL;DR**  
Find the wobble, show the fix, write it down, and nudge owners to tweak just enough. One book, one voice—without rewriting the map.

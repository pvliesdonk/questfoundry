# Story Spark — Reshape or Add Plot Topology

**Purpose**  
Introduce or reshape narrative structure—parts/chapters, **hubs**, **loops**, **gateways**, and **codeword** economy—then ripple changes through prose, hooks, and QA without leaking spoilers to player surfaces.

**Outcome**  
A stabilized topology update (in **Hot**) with section briefs and scene drafts, harvested hooks, and a Gatekeeper preview—ready to feed **Lore Deepening** and **Codex Expansion**, then merge to **Cold** after gatecheck.

---

## 1) Triggers (Showrunner)

- New chapter/act, subplot, or restructure request.
- Fixes for reachability/nonlinearity issues.
- Hook-led expansion (e.g., faction pressure suggests a new hub).

**Activation**  
Showrunner opens a **Trace Unit (TU)** for the change and confirms which optional roles (Researcher, Art/Audio, Translator) are **active** or **dormant** for this run.

---

## 2) Inputs

- Current **Cold** snapshot (canon, codex, style guardrails).
- Prior topology notes (Hot/Cold).
- Open hooks (if any) relevant to structure.
- Known QA findings (Integrity/Reachability/Nonlinearity).

---

## 3) Roles & Responsibilities

- **Plotwright (R)**  
  - Sketch/adjust topology: parts → sections → **hubs/loops/gateways**; define **codeword** plan.  
  - Mark **gateway conditions** in human terms (no schema names).  
  - Generate **narrative hooks** (entities, stakes, affordances).
- **Scene Smith (R)**  
  - Draft/adjust affected sections; embed choices and intended state effects in human wording.  
  - Generate **scene hooks** (traits, tells, props).
- **Style Lead (C)**  
  - Guard tone/voice; flag drift; suggest motif threading.
- **Lore Weaver (C)**  
  - Sanity-check feasibility vs canon; note likely lore needs (for **Lore Deepening**).
- **Codex Curator (C)**  
  - Identify taxonomy/clarity gaps (red-links) created by new structure.
- **Researcher (C, optional)**  
  - If active: identify factual constraints; add **factual hooks** with citations.
- **Gatekeeper (C)**  
  - Early preview: Integrity/Reachability/Nonlinearity sanity.

Showrunner (A) coordinates scope and timing.

## 4) Procedure

1. **Topology Draft (Plotwright)**  
   - Map parts/chapters and designate **hubs** (fan-out), **loops** (return-with-difference), and **gateways** (state-gated).  
   - For each gateway, write a **diegetic condition** PN can enforce (“foreman’s token”, “maintenance hex-key”).

2. **Section Briefs (Plotwright)**  
   - For each affected/new section: **intent**, **stakes**, **choices**, **expected state effect** (human phrasing), **references**.

3. **Prose Pass (Scene Smith)**  
   - Draft/adjust section text in style; make choices clear and distinct.  
   - Note intended state effects in comments (still human-level).

4. **Hook Generation (Plotwright & Scene Smith [+ Researcher if active])**  
   - Create **narrative/scene/factual** hook cards with rationales and uncertainty levels (see `HOOKS.md`).

5. **Style Check (Style Lead)**  
   - Sample sections; flag tone drift; propose motif anchors; suggest PN-surface phrasing patterns.

6. **Feasibility Check (Lore Weaver)**  
   - Flag canon collisions; suggest where **Lore Deepening** is needed.

7. **Preview Gate (Gatekeeper)**  
   - Run a quick **pre-gate**: Integrity (no accidental dead ends), Reachability (keystones reachable), Nonlinearity (hubs/loops exist & matter).

8. **Triage Hand-off**  
   - Pass the hook set to **Hook Harvest** loop; schedule **Lore Deepening** follow-up.

---

## 5) Deliverables (Hot)

- Updated **topology notes** (human prose): hubs/loops/gateways overview + rationale.
- **Section briefs** and draft prose for changed/new sections.
- **Hook list** (narrative/scene/factual) with triage tags candidate.
- **Style** addendum (if any) and motif notes.
- **Pre-gate note** (Gatekeeper): early findings & risks.
- TU updated with all upstream refs and predicted downstream impacts.

---

## 6) Merge Path (summary)

Story Spark itself does **not** merge to Cold. It prepares inputs for:

- **Hook Harvest** → **Lore Deepening** → **Codex Expansion** → **Gatecheck** → **Merge to Cold**.

Only after those complete—and Gatekeeper passes—do related changes merge.

---

## 7) Success Criteria

- Topology adds or repairs **meaningful** nonlinearity (not decorative).
- Gateways have **clear diegetic conditions** PN can enforce without leaks.
- At least one **loop** returns with **difference** (via codeword/state).
- Drafted sections are **in-voice** and **choice-clear**.
- Hooks are small, rationalized, and triaged-ready.
- Pre-gate shows **no accidental dead ends**; keystones remain reachable.

---

## 8) Failure Modes & Remedies

- **Cosmetic hub/loop** → Add outcome differences; re-justify or remove.  
- **Ambiguous gateway** → Rewrite condition in-world; ensure at least one path to meet it.  
- **Overcoupled restructure** → Split into smaller TUs; stage changes.  
- **Style wobble** → Run **Style Tune-up** before escalating.  
- **Research dormant** → Mark relevant hooks `uncorroborated:<risk>`; log revisit.

## 9) RACI (quick)

| Task | R | A | C | I |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Topology draft | Plotwright | Showrunner | Lore, Style, Gatekeeper | Scene |
| Section prose | Scene Smith | Style Lead (voice) | Plotwright, Gatekeeper | Binder |
| Hook set | Plotwright, Scene | Showrunner | Researcher, Lore, Curator | Gatekeeper |
| Pre-gate | Gatekeeper | Showrunner | Plotwright, Scene | All |

---

## 10) Hand-offs

- To **Hook Harvest**: the hook list + topology delta.  
- To **Lore Deepening**: accepted hooks that require canon backfill.  
- To **Codex Expansion**: the taxonomy/clarity needs list.  
- To **Style Tune-up**: any drift notes that exceed minor edits.

---

**TL;DR**  
Design or reshape the map (hubs/loops/gateways/codewords), draft the sections to inhabit it, generate tidy hooks, pass a quick gate sanity check, and hand off to harvesting and deepening. Structure first, canon next, player surface last.

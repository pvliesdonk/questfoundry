# Playbooks — One-Page, Do-This-Now Guides

Playbooks are **checklist-ready** summaries of the targeted loops. When you already know _what_ you’re doing and just need the **“how in one page,”** grab the matching playbook below.

> Playbooks change **Hot** and only reach **Cold** after Gatekeeper passes the Quality Bars. Keep **SPOILER_HYGIENE.md** and **ACCESSIBILITY_AND_CONTENT_NOTES.md** open when you run them.

## Quick chooser (what you need → which playbook)

| You need…                                           | Use this                       | Outcome                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Add/reshape hubs, loops, gateways; seed drafts      | `playbook_story_spark.md`      | Topology delta + briefs/drafts + hooks ready for triage            |
| Cluster triageable ideas from drafting/research     | `playbook_hook_harvest.md`     | Harvest Sheet: accepted/deferred/rejected + next-loop owners       |
| Turn accepted hooks into coherent canon             | `playbook_lore_deepening.md`   | Canon Pack + downstream notes + player-safe summaries              |
| Publish player-safe terms & crosslinks              | `playbook_codex_expansion.md`  | Codex Pack with entries + See-also map                             |
| Realign voice/register/motifs (no structure change) | `playbook_style_tune_up.md`    | Style Addendum + targeted edit notes + pre-gate                    |
| Decide what to illustrate (and maybe render)        | `playbook_art_touch_up.md`     | Art Plan (+ optional renders & determinism logs)                   |
| Decide what to hear (and maybe produce assets)      | `playbook_audio_pass.md`       | Audio Plan (+ optional assets & reproducibility notes)             |
| Build a target-language slice                       | `playbook_translation_pass.md` | Language Pack (glossary, register, localized surfaces, % coverage) |

## When to use playbooks vs. full loop guides

- **Playbook** = you’re executing and want **checklists, roles, deliverables, success criteria** on one page.
- **Full loop guide** (in `../LOOPS/`) = you’re planning or teaching the loop and want deeper rationale, anti-patterns, and examples.

---

## Shared guardrails (apply to every playbook)

- Work in **Hot**; merge to **Cold** only after **Gatekeeper** passes **Integrity, Reachability, Nonlinearity, Gateways, Style, Determinism (if promised), Presentation**.
- Player surfaces obey **SPOILER_HYGIENE.md**; accessibility baselines in **ACCESSIBILITY_AND_CONTENT_NOTES.md**.
- Each run sits inside a **Trace Unit (TU)**; record inputs/outputs and bar pressure.
- **Dormancy policy**: Showrunner decides which optional roles wake (Researcher, Art/Audio, Translator); plan-only merges as **deferred** are allowed.

**TL;DR**  
Pick the right playbook, open a TU, run the checklist, hand off cleanly, and let the Gatekeeper keep us honest.

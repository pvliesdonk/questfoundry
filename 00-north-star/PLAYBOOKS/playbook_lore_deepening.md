# Playbook — Lore Deepening

**Use when:** A **Hook Harvest** has marked hooks as `accepted` and you need to turn them into coherent **canon** (backstories, timelines, metaphysics, causal links) without leaking spoilers to player surfaces.

**Outcome:** A **Canon Pack** (spoiler-level), with contradiction resolutions, timeline anchors, and downstream notes for Plotwright/Scene Smith, plus player-safe handoffs to **Codex Expansion**. Ready for gatecheck and Cold merge.

---

## 1) One-minute scope (Showrunner)

- [ ] Define **theme/cluster** (e.g., “Kestrel arc”, “Wormhole economy”).
- [ ] Confirm **Researcher** active/dormant; set risk posture for factual claims.
- [ ] Open/attach TU: `tu-lore-deepening-<cluster>` with success criteria (see §7).
- [ ] Timebox the pass (e.g., 60–90 minutes per cluster).

---

## 2) Inputs you need on screen

- **Accepted hooks** for this cluster (with triage tags & uncertainty levels).
- Current **Cold** canon & codex pages (for collision checks).
- Relevant topology deltas (from **Story Spark**) and style guardrails.
- Research memos or `uncorroborated:<risk>` flags.

---

## 3) Do the thing (compact procedure)

**Lore Weaver (R)**

1. **Frame the canon question(s)** (1–3 lines each).
2. **Draft the canon answer** (precise causal account): backstory, timeline anchors, implicated entities/factions, constraints (tech/magic), metaphysics where relevant.
3. **Check collisions** against Cold; reconcile or mark **deliberate mystery** (with bounds + revisit window).
4. **Enumerate consequences**:
   - **Topology** notes (gateways/loops affected; hand to Plotwright).
   - **Prose** notes (foreshadow/recall/descriptive details; hand to Scene Smith).
5. **Tag sensitivity** (`spoiler-heavy` vs `player-safe-summary-possible`).

**Researcher (C, optional)** 6. Validate factual claims; attach citations or keep `uncorroborated:<risk>` with PN/Binder wording guidance.

**Style Lead (C)** 7. Quick **tone/motif** pass on canon notes (no rewrites—just guidance).

**Gatekeeper (C)** 8. **Pre-gate**: spot Integrity/Reachability/Gateway risks; presentation safety for any player-safe summaries.

**Package (Lore Weaver)** 9. Assemble the **Canon Pack** and attach to TU. Prepare **player-safe summaries** for **Codex Expansion**.

---

## 4) Deliverables (Hot)

- **Canon Pack** (one entry per question):
  - Title, **Canon Answer**, **Timeline anchors**, **Entities/Factions**, **Constraints**, **Sensitivity tag**, **Upstream hooks/TUs**, **Downstream impacts**, **Notes**.
- **Prose Notes** → Scene Smith.
- **Topology Notes** → Plotwright.
- **Factual Appendix** → citations or `uncorroborated:<risk>`.
- **Pre-gate note** (Gatekeeper).

---

## 5) Handoffs

- → **Codex Expansion**: player-safe summaries + cross-ref suggestions.
- → **Story Spark**: if topology must adjust (gateways/loops).
- → **Style Tune-up**: if style guidance implies systemic phrasing updates.

---

## 6) Definition of “done” (for this loop)

- [ ] Each accepted hook is **canonized** or **deferred** with reason (or **rejected** with rationale).
- [ ] Collisions resolved or **deliberate mystery** logged with bounds & revisit date.
- [ ] Timeline anchors added where relevant.
- [ ] Prose/Topology notes handed off and linked in the TU.
- [ ] Player-safe summaries extracted for Codex; spoilers quarantined.
- [ ] Factual claims have citations or explicit `uncorroborated:<risk>` flags.
- [ ] Gatekeeper pre-gate recorded.

---

## 7) Success criteria (Showrunner quick check)

- Canon **reduces ambiguity** and **unlocks work** (prose/topology) rather than bloating lore.
- Nonlinearity is supported, not sabotaged (no secret single true path).
- Player-safe surface can be written **without** telegraphing twists.
- Risk from dormant Researcher (if any) is **explicit** and time-boxed.

## 8) RACI (micro)

| Task                  | R            | A          | C                                                  | I          |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Draft canon & package | Lore Weaver  | Showrunner | Researcher\*, Style, Plotwright, Scene, Gatekeeper | Codex      |
| Factual validation    | Researcher\* | Showrunner | Lore Weaver                                        | Gatekeeper |
| Pre-gate              | Gatekeeper   | Showrunner | Lore Weaver                                        | All        |
| Handoffs              | Lore Weaver  | Showrunner | Codex Curator, Plotwright, Scene Smith             | Gatekeeper |

\*If Researcher is dormant, leave `uncorroborated:<risk>` and PN/Binder guidance.

## 9) Mini template (Canon Entry)

```

Title: <concise label>
Canon Answer: <precise causal account, spoiler-level>
Timeline: <anchors>
Entities/Factions: <list>
Constraints: <tech/magic rules that now apply>
Sensitivity: <spoiler-heavy | player-safe-summary-possible>
Upstream: <hook IDs, TU IDs>
Downstream: <Plot/Scene/Codex impacts>
Notes: <deliberate-mystery? revisit date?>

```

---

## 10) Anti-patterns

- Turning codex summaries into hidden canon: **Curator publishes summaries only; deep detail stays in canon notes.**
- Canon that **forces** linearity without intent: reroute to Story Spark or split the change.
- Bundling five unrelated mysteries into one TU: split by **player value** cluster.

**Cheat line (TU note):**  
“Lore Deepening (Kestrel arc): canonizes Dock-7 fire backstory; anchors Y–18; adds Syndicate constraint; 2 topology notes → Story Spark; 3 prose notes → Scene; codex summaries ready; research `uncorroborated:low` on valve model.”

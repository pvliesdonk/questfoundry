# Playbook — Story Spark

**Use when:** You want to add or reshape plot topology (parts/chapters, **hubs**, **loops**, **gateways**, **codeword** economy) and kick off a small burst that won’t leak spoilers to player surfaces.

**Outcome:** A crisp topology delta with section briefs + draft prose, a tidy hook set ready for **Hook Harvest**, and a Gatekeeper pre-check. Story Spark itself doesn’t merge to Cold.

---

## 1) One-minute scope (Showrunner)

- [ ] Define **slice** (chapter/arc/fix) and **timebox**.
- [ ] Mark optional roles **active/dormant** (Researcher, Art/Audio, Translator).
- [ ] Open TU: `tu-story-spark-<topic>` and note success criteria (see §6).

---

## 2) Inputs you need on screen

- Latest **Cold** snapshot (canon, codex, style guardrails).
- Any prior topology notes (Hot/Cold).
- Open QA risks (Integrity / Reachability / Nonlinearity).
- Relevant hooks (if this run was hook-triggered).

---

## 3) Do the thing (compact procedure)

**Plotwright (R)**

1. Sketch/adjust topology map: where are the **hubs**, **loops**, and **gateways**?
2. For every gateway, write the **diegetic condition** (token/reputation/knowledge/tool).
3. Draft **section briefs** (intent, stakes, choices, expected state effect—human phrasing).
4. Generate **narrative hooks** (entities, stakes, affordances).

**Scene Smith (R)** 5. Draft/adjust **section prose**; make choices legible and distinct. 6. Generate **scene hooks** (traits, tells, props).

**Style Lead (C)** 7. Sample and flag drift; add motif anchors; suggest PN phrasing patterns.

**Lore Weaver (C)** 8. Sanity-check against canon; note where **Lore Deepening** is needed.

**Researcher (C, if active)** 9. Add **factual hooks** with citations or `uncorroborated:<risk>`.

**Gatekeeper (C)** 10. **Pre-gate**: Integrity (no dangling refs), Reachability (keystones reachable), Nonlinearity (hub/loop not cosmetic).

---

## 4) Deliverables (Hot)

- **Topology delta** (human prose): hubs/loops/gateways + codeword plan & rationale.
- **Section briefs** + **draft prose** for changed/new sections.
- **Hook list** (narrative/scene/factual) with rationale; mark candidates for triage.
- **Style addendum (mini)** if needed (motif cues, PN phrasing).
- **Pre-gate note** from Gatekeeper (findings/risks).
- TU updated with upstream refs and predicted downstream impacts.

---

## 5) Hand-off map

- → **Hook Harvest** (accepted/triage hooks).
- → **Lore Deepening** (any hook that needs canon backfill).
- → **Codex Expansion** (taxonomy/clarity gaps).
- → **Style Tune-up** (if drift exceeds trivial edits).

_(Story Spark does **not** merge to Cold. Merges happen after deepening + gatecheck.)_

---

## 6) Definition of “done” (for this loop)

- [ ] At least one **meaningful** loop (return with difference via state/codeword).
- [ ] Gateways have **clear diegetic** conditions PN can enforce.
- [ ] No accidental dead ends; keystones remain reachable.
- [ ] Drafted sections are **in-voice**; choices are distinct.
- [ ] Hooks are small, rationalized, and **ready for harvest**.
- [ ] TU updated with risks and hand-offs.

---

## 7) Fast triage rubric (Showrunner)

- **Advance now**: fixes contradictions, unlocks keystone, adds meaningful hub/loop.
- **Defer**: requires dormant roles you won’t awaken; causes high churn for low gain.
- **Drop**: decorative nonlinearity; ambiguous gateway you can’t phrase diegetically.

## 8) RACI (micro)

| Task              | R           | A          | C                        | I          |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------ | ---------- |
| Scope/timebox     | Showrunner  | Showrunner | Gatekeeper, Leads        | All        |
| Topology & briefs | Plotwright  | Showrunner | Lore, Style, Gatekeeper  | Scene      |
| Draft prose       | Scene Smith | Style Lead | Plotwright, Gatekeeper   | Binder     |
| Pre-gate          | Gatekeeper  | Showrunner | Plotwright, Scene, Style | All        |
| Handoffs          | Showrunner  | Showrunner | Receiving role leads     | Gatekeeper |

---

## 9) Anti-patterns to catch

- “Loop” that reads identical after return.
- Gateway phrased with internals (“lack CODEWORD: …”).
- Dumping twists into codex drafts.
- Bundling too many unrelated changes into one TU.

**Cheat line (commit/TU note):**  
“Story Spark: add hub at **Dock 7**, loop via **Union Token**, gateway ‘foreman’s token’; 3 briefs + 2 drafts; 6 hooks → Harvest; pre-gate green on Integrity/Reachability.”

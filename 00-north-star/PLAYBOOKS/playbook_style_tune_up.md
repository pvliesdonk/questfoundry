# Playbook — Style Tune-up

**Use when:** Voice/register/motif drift is visible in prose, captions, PN lines, or localization. You need a focused pass that realigns surfaces without changing story structure.

**Outcome:** A **Style Addendum** (rules + exemplars), targeted **edit notes** to owners, and a green **Style/Presentation** pre-gate. Changes merge after owners apply edits.

---

## 1) One-minute scope (Showrunner)

- [ ] Define **slice** (chapters/sections/captions/PN lines).
- [ ] Timebox the pass (e.g., 60–90 minutes).
- [ ] Open TU: `tu-style-tune-<scope>`.
- [ ] Confirm optional roles (Art/Audio/Translator) **active/dormant**.

---

## 2) Inputs you need on screen

- Current **Cold** style guide (voice, register, motifs, exemplars).
- Recent drafts (Hot): target sections, captions, PN lines.
- PN Principles (diegetic gates phrasing patterns).
- Any localization notes (if Translator is active).

---

## 3) Do the thing (compact procedure)

**Style Lead (R)**

1. **Sample & diagnose** drift; tag issues: `voice-shift`, `register-mismatch`, `motif-missing`, `over-exposition`, `jargon-spike`.
2. Write **exemplars (before/after)** that show the desired fix in 1–3 lines.
3. Draft **Style Addendum**: rules, motif kit refresh, PN phrasing patterns, localization cautions.

**Scene/PN/Caption owners (C)** 4. Receive **edit notes**: `target → issue → fix suggestion`. Propose minimal rewrites that preserve meaning.

**Plotwright (C)** 5. Sanity: edits don’t alter topology/gateways or codeword economy.

**Translator (C, optional)** 6. Flag untranslatables; suggest functionally equivalent phrasing.

**Gatekeeper (C)** 7. **Pre-gate**: Style + Presentation Safety (no spoilers/technique talk on surfaces).

**Style Lead (R)** 8. Package Addendum + Edit Notes + Pre-gate into the TU.

## 4) Deliverables (Hot)

- **Style Addendum** (rules, motif kit, PN phrasing patterns, localization tips).
- **Edit Notes** per target (section/caption/PN line).
- **Pre-gate note** (Gatekeeper) with specific remediation, if any.

---

## 5) Hand-offs

- Owners apply edits → resubmit to Style Lead for spot-check.
- If captions/PN lines changed, inform **Binder** (export surfaces) and **PN** (script bank).
- If localization active, send Addendum to **Translator**.

---

## 6) Definition of “done” (for this play)

- [ ] Addendum compiled with exemplars; drift categories addressed.
- [ ] Edit notes issued; owners confirm minimal-meaning-change rewrites.
- [ ] Gatekeeper **pre-gate green** on Style/Presentation or clear remediation list.
- [ ] TU updated with affected targets and follow-ups.

---

## 7) Fast heuristics

- Prefer **small, surgical edits** over global rewrites.
- When tension rises, **compress sentences** and **sharpen verbs**.
- Re-thread **motifs** (3–5 recurring images/sounds) across the slice.
- Keep **codex invites** gentle; avoid encyclopedia tone.
- PN remains **diegetic**; no internal labels or mechanics.

## 8) RACI (micro)

| Task                | R              | A          | C                                | I          |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Diagnose & addendum | Style Lead     | Showrunner | Scene, PN, Art/Audio, Translator | Gatekeeper |
| Apply edits         | Content owners | Showrunner | Style Lead                       | Gatekeeper |
| Pre-gate            | Gatekeeper     | Showrunner | Style Lead                       | All        |
| Merge (after fixes) | Showrunner     | Showrunner | Gatekeeper                       | Binder, PN |

## 9) Mini exemplars (patterns)

**Voice tighten (tension)**

- Before: “In low gravity, you are floating and it feels disorienting while alarms blare.”
- After: “Low-G lifts you an inch. The alarms chew the corridor.”

**Diegetic gate phrasing**

- Before: “Option locked: missing CODEWORD.”
- After: “No union token on your lapel; the foreman waves you back.”

**Localization caution**

- Rule: Avoid idioms without direct equivalents; provide functional phrasing (“on the level” → “honest, aboveboard”).

---

## 10) Anti-patterns

- Smuggling structural changes via “style” edits.
- Explaining twists in captions to “clarify tone.”
- Rewriting character idiolect into uniform narrator voice.
- Over-engineering motif density into every paragraph.

---

**Cheat line (TU note):**  
“Style Tune-up (Act I): tighten voice, re-thread ‘low-G/relay-hum’ motifs; PN gate phrasing bank updated; 18 edit notes issued; pre-gate Style/Presentation green.”

# Playbook — Codex Expansion

**Use when:** New canon landed (from **Lore Deepening**) or the manuscript keeps using terms the player needs explained. Also use to resolve **taxonomy/clarity hooks** (coverage gaps, red-links).

**Outcome:** A **Codex Pack** (player-safe entries + crosslink map) ready for gatecheck and merge to **Cold**—without leaking spoilers or internal plumbing.

---

## 1) One-minute scope (Showrunner)

- [ ] Define **topic/batch** (e.g., “Dock infrastructure”, “Factions v1”).
- [ ] Confirm **bias** (player comprehension first? localization readiness?).
- [ ] Open/attach TU: `tu-codex-<topic-or-batch>`.
- [ ] Note any **dormant roles** (Researcher, Translator) and risk posture.

---

## 2) Inputs you need on screen

- **Canon Pack** entries for the topic (spoiler-level; from Lore Deepening).
- **Style guardrails** (register, motif language).
- Current **Cold codex** pages (for alignment).
- Accepted **taxonomy/clarity hooks**.
- PN/Binder notes about comprehension/navigation.

---

## 3) Do the thing (compact procedure)

**Curator (R)**

1. **Pick terms** with highest **player value** (frequency in manuscript or UX friction).
2. Draft **player-safe entries** using this anatomy:
   - **Title**, **Overview (2–4 sentences)**, **Usage in the book**, **Context**, **See also (3–5)**, **Notes** (accessibility/localization), **Lineage: TU …**
   - Keep spoilers out; no internal labels (codewords, gate logic, seeds, schema).
3. Build a **Crosslink Map** (ensure See also resolves; add disambiguations).

**Lore Weaver (C)** 4. **Spoiler sweep**: compare to canon; remove or mask reveals.

**Style Lead (C)** 5. **Tone pass**: ensure clarity, reading level, and motif resonance.

**Gatekeeper (C)** 6. **Pre-check**: Presentation Safety, Integrity (links resolve), Style.

**Curator (R)** 7. Package entries + crosslink map into a **Codex Pack** attached to the TU.

## 4) Deliverables (Hot)

- **Codex Pack**
  - Entries (Title, Overview, Usage, Context, See also, Notes, Lineage).
  - **Crosslink Map** (list of edges; note any required stubs).
- **Coverage report**
  - New terms covered; remaining gaps; taxonomy hooks resolved/deferred.
- **Spoiler hygiene note**
  - What was masked; any entries deferred to avoid reveal timing.

---

## 5) Hand-offs

- → **Binding Run**: notify Binder that new player surfaces will be available after merge.
- → **Translation Pass**: provide glossary seeds & style notes if Translator is active.
- → **PN**: phrase suggestions for gentle codex invites (optional).

---

## 6) Definition of “done” (for this play)

- [ ] High-frequency terms **have entries**.
- [ ] **No spoilers**; PN can reference safely.
- [ ] **All links resolve**; See also adds useful navigation.
- [ ] Style/reading level matches the guardrails.
- [ ] TU lists **coverage** and any **deferred** items with wake conditions.

---

## 7) Fast triage rubric (Curator)

- **Include now**: terms that clarify active choices, hubs, or recurring factions/locations.
- **Defer**: entries that are only meaningful **after** a reveal; mark with wake condition (“after Act II merge”).
- **Drop**: overly narrow trivia that doesn’t aid comprehension.

## 8) RACI (micro)

| Task                  | R             | A          | C           | I          |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Draft entries & links | Codex Curator | Showrunner | Lore, Style | Gatekeeper |
| Spoiler sweep         | Lore Weaver   | Showrunner | Curator     | Gatekeeper |
| Style pass            | Style Lead    | Showrunner | Curator     | Gatekeeper |
| Pre-check             | Gatekeeper    | Showrunner | —           | All        |
| Merge to Cold         | Showrunner    | Showrunner | Gatekeeper  | Binder, PN |

## 9) Template (copy/paste)

```

Title: <player-facing term>

Overview:
<2–4 sentences, neutral and spoiler-safe. Avoid causal reveals and internals.>

Usage in the book:
<How/why the player sees this term.>

Context:
<Setting notes that aid comprehension; no twist details.>

See also:

* <related entry 1>
* <related entry 2>
* <related entry 3>

Notes:
<accessibility/localization hints (pronunciation, units, diacritics).>

Lineage:
TU <id>

```

## 10) Anti-patterns to catch

- Codex page “helpfully” explaining a twist.
- See also lists that loop back into themselves without breadth.
- Style drift into encyclopedia-ese; keep it readable and in register.
- Turning taxonomy work into secret canon (escalate to Lore Weaver).

**Cheat line (TU note):**  
“Codex Expansion (Dock infra): added **Dock 7**, **Maintenance Decks**, **Salvage Permits**; 15 links; masked refinery cause per canon; 2 terms deferred until Act II; Gatekeeper pre-check green.”

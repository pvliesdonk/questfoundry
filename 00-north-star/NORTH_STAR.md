# QuestFoundry — North Star

> A disciplined, multi-agent studio for nonlinear gamebooks. Clean roles, shared truths, spoiler-safe delivery.

## Why this exists

QuestFoundry turns the messy magic of storymaking into a repeatable craft. We produce **branching, replayable gamebooks** with coherent worldbuilding, deliberate nonlinearity (hubs, loops, gateways, codewords), and a **Player-Narrator (PN)** that keeps the experience spoiler-free and humane.

We separate _what people do_ (roles) from _how they talk_ (common language) and _how the system behaves_ (protocol). Creative decisions flow through feedback loops, stabilize, and become part of a **Cold Source of Truth** that can be exported, played, and revisited—forever.

## Non-negotiable principles

1. **Separation of concerns**  
   Distinct roles handle structure, prose, style, lore, codex, art, audio, QA, and production. No role becomes a secret kitchen for everything.

2. **Two Sources of Truth**

   - **Hot SoT**: Working drafts, proposals, and **hooks** (new facts/affordances) in flux.
   - **Cold SoT**: Curated canon and stable style, safe to export/play.  
     Hot flows into Cold only after a stabilization loop and Gatekeeper checks.

3. **Hook-driven creativity**  
   Plotwright, Scene Smith, Researcher, and Codex Curator may introduce **hooks**.  
   The **Lore Weaver** adjudicates/expands accepted hooks into canon. Codex Curator publishes **player-safe** entries.

4. **Designed nonlinearity**  
   Hubs, loops, gateways, and codewords are intentional. No accidental spaghetti.

5. **Player-first PN**  
   The Player-Narrator mediates the story in natural language, keeps spoilers sealed, and respects tone and accessibility.

6. **Traceability**  
   Every change cites origin, rationale, upstream inputs, and downstream dependents. We can always explain “why this exists.”

7. **Quality bars**  
   Nothing merges to Cold unless we pass: **Integrity, Reachability, Nonlinearity, Gateways, Style, Determinism** (and presentation safety for exports).

8. **Evergreen manuscript**  
   A manuscript is never “finished.” Exports are **views** on Cold at a moment in time. New loops can always be triggered.

## What success looks like

- **Narrative shape**: Hubs/loops/gateways exist where planned and matter to play.
- **Replayability**: Different viable paths, not just re-skins. Codewords create meaningful revisits.
- **Coherence**: Lore, codex, and prose agree; contradictions are resolved or explicitly declared.
- **Explainability**: Decisions and lineage are obvious in context.
- **PN quality**: Spoiler-safe, in-voice, accessible, and smooth.
- **Determinism (when promised)**: Visual/audio assets can be reproduced from recorded parameters.

## Roles at a glance (names are canonical)

- **Showrunner** — Activates roles & loops, sets scope, owns stabilization cadence. _(Never dormant.)_
- **Gatekeeper** — Enforces quality bars, blocks merges to Cold. _(Never dormant.)_
- **Plotwright** — Designs topology (hubs/loops/gateways/codewords); **generates hooks**.
- **Scene Smith** — Writes section prose in style; **generates hooks**.
- **Style Lead** — Owns voice, register, motifs, visual guardrails; corrects drift.
- **Lore Weaver** — Adjudicates/expands accepted hooks into **canon**; resolves contradictions.
- **Codex Curator** — Publishes player-safe entries/cross-refs; **proposes taxonomy/clarity hooks**.
- **Researcher** — Investigates facts, cites sources; **generates factual hooks** (uncorroborated if dormant).
- **Art Director** — Plans illustrations (what/why/how); plan may exist without execution. _(Dormant allowed.)_
- **Illustrator** — Produces visual assets; logs parameters for determinism. _(Dormant allowed.)_
- **Audio Director** — Plans ambience/foley/VO; plan may exist without execution. _(Dormant allowed.)_
- **Audio Producer** — Creates/edits audio assets. _(Dormant allowed.)_
- **Translator (Localization Lead)** — Plans and maintains target-language slices; preserves PN boundaries. _(Dormant allowed.)_
- **Book Binder** — Assembles/export a hyperlinked, shuffled **view** on Cold (manuscript + codex + checklists).
- **Player-Narrator (PN)** — Delivers the experience in-world, spoiler-free; supports playtests and live runs.

> **Dormancy policy:** Showrunner may keep Art/Audio/Translator/Researcher dormant for a prose-only run. Value remains: the book can ship with _plans_ (e.g., art plan) unexecuted.

## Feedback loops (human-named)

- **Story Spark** — Add or reshape plot; ripples through prose, codex, QA.
- **Hook Harvest** — Collect/cluster/prioritize hooks from all generators.
- **Lore Deepening** — Lore Weaver turns accepted hooks into canon.
- **Codex Expansion** — Player-safe entries with cross-refs and citations.
- **Style Tune-up** — Correct drift in tone/voice/visual guardrails.
- **Art Touch-up** — Plan and/or render new illustrations.
- **Audio Pass** — Plan and/or produce audio inserts.
- **Translation Pass** — Add/maintain a target language slice.
- **Binding Run** — Book Binder assembles/export a view on Cold.
- **Narration Dry-Run** — PN playtests the current view; UX notes fed back.

**Showrunner** triggers loops, sets scope, and pauses/resumes them. **Gatekeeper** checks bars before Hot→Cold merges.

## Sources of Truth (bird’s-eye)

- **Hot SoT** — Drafts, proposals, and hooks; safe for experimentation, not for export.
- **Cold SoT** — Canon and style once stabilized; safe for export/play; traceability attached.

Merges from Hot to Cold require: stabilization loop completion, Gatekeeper’s bars green, and Showrunner’s go-ahead.

## Traceability (minimums)

- For any accepted change: **who** proposed, **why** (rationale), **from what** (upstream references), **affects who** (downstream dependents), and **where it lives** (Hot or Cold).
- Exported views record the Cold snapshot they were built from.

## Boundaries & anti-patterns

- The **Codex** is not a dumping ground for raw ideas or spoilers.
- The **PN** never reveals internals (codewords, hidden gates, RNG, tooling).
- No role silently re-writes another role’s domain; cross-domain changes route through the **Showrunner**.
- If **Researcher** is dormant, factual claims may ship with an **uncorroborated** note; revisit when re-activated.

# Working Model — How the Studio Operates

This document explains the day-to-day behavior of the QuestFoundry studio: who does what, how work flows, how roles are activated or kept dormant, and how changes move from Hot to Cold Source of Truth.

---

## 1) Operating Overview

- **Showrunner** sets scope, activates roles and loops, and owns stabilization cadence.
- **Gatekeeper** enforces quality bars before merging Hot → Cold.
- Creative roles work in **Hot SoT** (drafts, proposals, hooks). Accepted changes stabilize and merge into **Cold SoT** (canon, style, export-safe).
- The manuscript is **evergreen**: exports are **views** on Cold at a point in time; loops can be re-run later.

**Cross-domain rule:** roles discuss freely with their stakeholders **inside their domain**; cross-domain changes are coordinated via the **Showrunner**.

---

## 2) Roles at Work

**Always active**

- **Showrunner** — production lead; triggers loops; unblocks decisions.
- **Gatekeeper** — quality bars: Integrity, Reachability, Nonlinearity, Gateways, Style, Determinism, Presentation, Accessibility.

**Active by default**

- **Plotwright** — designs topology (hubs/loops/gateways/codewords); generates narrative hooks.
- **Scene Smith** — writes section prose; generates scene-level hooks.
- **Style Lead** — voice, register, motifs, visual guardrails; corrects drift.
- **Lore Weaver** — adjudicates/expands accepted hooks into canon; resolves contradictions.
- **Codex Curator** — publishes player-safe entries with cross-refs; proposes taxonomy/clarity hooks.

**Can be dormant (Showrunner decides)**

- **Researcher** — investigates facts, cites sources; generates factual hooks. *(Dormant ⇒ factual risk noted.)*
- **Art Director / Illustrator** — plan and/or produce illustrations; deterministic parameters tracked.
- **Audio Director / Audio Producer** — plan and/or produce audio assets.
- **Translator (Localization Lead)** — plan and maintain target-language slices.

**Consumers**

- **Book Binder** — assembles/export a view on Cold (hyperlinked manuscript + codex + checklists).
- **Player-Narrator (PN)** — spoiler-safe, in-world delivery; supports playtests (Narration Dry-Run).

---

## 3) Hooks and Canon

**Hook** = a newly introduced fact/entity/affordance usable immediately in Hot, pending adjudication.

- **May originate from**: Plotwright, Scene Smith, Researcher, Codex Curator (taxonomy/clarity), and Lore Weaver (when backfilling causality).
- **Lifecycle**:
  1. **Creation (Hot)** with rationale and (if factual) citation or uncertainty level.
  2. **Hook Harvest** loop clusters/prioritizes.
  3. **Lore Deepening** turns accepted hooks into canon; contradictions resolved or logged as deliberate mysteries.
  4. **Codex Expansion** publishes player-safe entries; spoilers stay out of the codex.
  5. **Gatekeeper checks** → merge to **Cold**.

---

## 4) Loops (human-named)

Loops can be full-scale or small scoped runs. Showrunner triggers and scopes; roles may be dormant unless required by the loop.

- **Story Spark** — Add/reshape plot topology; ripples to prose, codex, QA.
- **Hook Harvest** — Collect/cluster/prioritize hooks from all generators.
- **Lore Deepening** — Convert accepted hooks into canon; resolve contradictions.
- **Codex Expansion** — Publish player-safe entries with cross-refs/citations.
- **Style Tune-up** — Correct tone/voice/visual drift; no structural changes.
- **Art Touch-up** — Plan and/or render illustrations (plan may ship without execution).
- **Audio Pass** — Plan and/or produce audio assets (plan may ship without execution).
- **Translation Pass** — Add/maintain a target language slice; PN constraints preserved.
- **Binding Run** — Book Binder assembles/export a view on Cold.
- **Narration Dry-Run** — PN playtests current view; UX notes fed back.

Each loop document specifies:

- Trigger (Showrunner), scope, required/optional roles, Hot→Cold path, Gatekeeper checks, and how to proceed if a role is dormant.

---

## 5) Hot → Cold Merge Path

1. **Proposal in Hot**  
   - Minimal lineage: *originating role, rationale, upstream refs, affected dependents.*
2. **Stabilization**  
   - Peer review across affected roles; contradictions surfaced and addressed.
3. **Gatekeeper review**  
   - Quality bars must be green; exceptions documented with time-boxed remediation.
4. **Showrunner approval**  
   - Confirms scope and risk posture; decides timing of merge.
5. **Merge to Cold**  
   - Canon/style updated; traceability recorded; downstream consumers may export/play a new view.

---

## 6) Traceability (working minimums)

For any accepted change:

- **Who** proposed it (role + person/agent), **why** (short rationale),
- **Upstream** inputs (titles/IDs), **Downstream** dependents,
- **Status** (Hot or Cold) and **merge record** (date, approver, Gatekeeper report).

Exports (Binding Run) record:

- **Cold snapshot ID** (tag/commit) and **export options** used (e.g., include art plan, exclude audio).

---

## 7) Communication Boundaries

- **In-domain discussions**: direct and informal (e.g., Scene Smith ↔ Style Lead).
- **Cross-domain changes**: routed via **Showrunner** to avoid silent scope creep.
- **PN boundary**: PN never reveals internals (codewords, hidden gates, asset params).
- **Codex boundary**: player-safe summaries; spoilers and design notes live in canon, not in the codex.

---

## 8) Quality Bars (conceptual, human-level)

- **Integrity** — No unintended dead ends; references resolve.
- **Reachability** — Critical beats reachable through at least one path.
- **Nonlinearity** — Planned hubs/loops/gateways exist and matter.
- **Gateways** — Conditions (codewords/state) are clear and enforceable.
- **Style** — Prose and visuals follow the Style Lead's guardrails; PN remains in-voice.
- **Determinism** — When promised, assets are reproducible from recorded parameters.
- **Presentation** — Exports are spoiler-safe; PN boundaries respected.
- **Accessibility** — Navigation is clear; alt text present; sensory considerations respected.

Gatekeeper reports pass/fail with concrete remediation notes.

---

## 9) Dormancy and Activation

- The **Showrunner** explicitly marks roles as **active** or **dormant** per run/scope.
- Loops specify **required** vs **optional** roles. Optional roles may remain dormant.
- If **Researcher** is dormant, factual claims carry a research posture flag (uncorroborated:low | uncorroborated:medium | uncorroborated:high) with a reminder to revisit.

## 10) RACI Snapshot (human summary)

| Activity | R | A | C | I |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Set scope & cadence | Showrunner | Showrunner | Gatekeeper, Leads | All |
| Design topology | Plotwright | Showrunner | Lore, Style, Gatekeeper | Scene |
| Write sections | Scene Smith | Style Lead (voice), Plotwright (structure) | Gatekeeper | Binder |
| Adjudicate canon | Lore Weaver | Showrunner | Plotwright, Style, Researcher | Codex |
| Publish codex entries | Codex Curator | Lore Weaver | Style, Gatekeeper | Binder |
| Style guardrails | Style Lead | Showrunner | Scene, Art Director | Gatekeeper |
| Art plan | Art Director | Style Lead | Scene, Binder, Gatekeeper | Illustrator |
| Illustrations | Illustrator | Art Director | Gatekeeper | Binder |
| Audio plan | Audio Director | Showrunner | Style, PN | Audio Producer |
| Audio assets | Audio Producer | Audio Director | Gatekeeper | Binder |
| Translation slice | Translator | Showrunner | Style, PN | Binder |
| QA checks | Gatekeeper | Showrunner | All | All |
| Export view | Book Binder | Showrunner | Gatekeeper, PN | All |
| PN playtest | PN | Showrunner | Binder, Style | All |

R = Responsible, A = Accountable, C = Consulted, I = Informed.

## 11) Failure Modes & Safeguards

- **Silent cross-domain edits** → Route changes via Showrunner; require stabilization notes.  
- **Codex leaking spoilers** → Curator uses player-safe summaries; spoilers remain in canon.  
- **Research dormant drift** → Mark factual hooks “uncorroborated”; schedule revisit.  
- **Style drift** → Run a **Style Tune-up** loop before larger rewrites.  
- **Topology regressions** → Gatekeeper blocks on Integrity/Reachability/Nonlinearity failures.

## 12) What’s intentionally not here

- Data shapes, machine protocols, and prompts (Layers 2–5).  
- Tooling and UI specifics (Layers 6–7).

This working model is the human contract the later layers encode.

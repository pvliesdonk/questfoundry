(default path)\n  - motivated_by_greed: Lord Blackwood's acquisition is driven by greed.\n\n- **grimshaw_trust**: Can Inspector Sharp trust Mr. Grimshaw to tell the truth about the events of the night?\n  Central entities: the_detective, the_butler\n  Stakes: Trust is a central theme, highlighting moral complexities of justice and secrecy.\n  Alternatives:\n  - grimshaw_truthful: Mr. Grimshaw is truthful about the events of the night.

(default path)\n  - discover_murderer: The letter leads to the discovery of the murderer.\n\n- **langford_interest**: Is Dr. Henry Langford's interest in the Jade Serpent academic or driven by personal gain?\n  Central entities: the_scholar, the_artifact\n  Stakes: Exploring the moral implications of knowledge and greed.\n  Alternatives:\n  - personal_gain: Dr. Langford's interest is driven by personal gain. (default path)\n  - academic_interest: Dr. Langford's interest is purely academic.\n\n\n## Your Goal\nTransform the raw brainstorm material into committed story structure:\n\n1. **Entity Curation** - Decide which entities to keep\n   - You MUST make a retain/cut decision for EVERY entity (characters, locations, objects, AND factions)\n   - Retained: Essential for the story\n   - Cut: Interesting but not needed (can be reconsidered later)\n   - Aim to retain 8-15 entities for a focused story\n   - Don't skip faction entities - they need decisions too!\n\n2. **Dilemma Exploration** - Decide which alternatives to explore as paths\n   - Canonical alternative ALWAYS becomes a path (this is the spine/default path)\n   - Non-canonical alternatives become branches ONLY if you want to explore them\n   - More explored alternatives = more complex branching structure\n   - Each explored alternative becomes a plot path\n\n3. **Thread Creation** - For each explored alternative, create a path with:\n   - Name and description\n   - Tier: major (defines story, must interweave) or minor (supports, more independent)\n   - Consequences: What this path means narratively\n\n4. **Initial Beats** - Create 2-4 opening beats per path\n   - Beats are narrative units (scenes, moments, turning points)\n   - Mark which entities appear in each beat\n   - Note how each beat impacts tensions (advances, reveals, commits, complicates)\n\n5. **Convergence Sketch** - Hint at where paths should merge\n   - Where should branches reconverge?\n   - What differences persist after convergence?\n\n## Guidelines\n- THREAD FREEZE: After SEED, no new paths can be created\n- Focus on quality over quantity - a tight story beats a sprawling one\n- Every major path pair should share at least one natural intersection (intersection)\n- Initial beats should establish character, world, and central dilemma\n- Consider story length: micro (3-5 beats), short (5-10), medium (10-20), long (20+)\n## Research Tools Available\nYou have access to research tools for story structure guidance:\n- search_corpus: Search IF Craft Corpus for story structure techniques\n- get_document: Retrieve full documents from the corpus\n- list_clusters: Discover available topic clusters\n\nUse these for guidance on pacing, path interweaving, and beat structure.\n\n\n## Thread Tier Guidance\n- **Major paths** define the story. They must interweave with other majors.\n- **Minor paths** support and enrich. They touch the story but can be more independent.\n- Start with 1-2 major paths and 1-3 minor paths for manageable scope.\n\n## Dilemma Impact Effects\n- **advances**: Moves toward resolution without revealing answer\n- **reveals**: Surfaces information bearing on the question\n- **commits**: Point of no return - alternative is locked in\n- **complicates**: Introduces doubt, new dimension to the dilemma\n\n## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (repeated for emphasis)\n\nThese requirements MUST be followed. Failure to meet them will require revision.\n\n1. **Beat Count per Thread**: Create 2-4 opening beats PER THREAD.\n   - With 3 paths, you need 6-12 beats total\n   - With 5 paths, you need 10-20 beats total\n   - Fewer than 2 beats per path is NOT acceptable\n   - Each beat should serve a distinct narrative purpose\n\n2. **Location Diversity**: Vary locations across beats.\n   - Don't place all beats in the same location\n   - Each path should span at least 2 different retained locations\n   - Vary settings to create scene contrast and pacing variety\n   - Use location changes to mark narrative transitions\n\n3. **Entity Coverage**: Every entity needs a retain/cut decision.\n   - Characters, locations, objects, AND factions\n   - No entity should be left undecided\n## Mode: Autonomous\nYou are running without user interaction. Make confident curation decisions\nconsistent with the creative vision and brainstormed material above.

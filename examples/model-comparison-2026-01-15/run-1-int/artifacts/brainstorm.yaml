  - entity_id: study
    entity_category: location
    concept: A room with a clock that ticks backward, indicating temporal
      anomaly.
    notes: The clock in the study strikes three, then four, then back to three.

tensions:
  - dilemma_id: mirror_distortion
    question: Does the mirror’s distortion reflect reality or reveal hidden
      truths?
    alternatives:
      - alternative_id: reflected_reality
        description: The mirror shows only what is real — the reflection is
          accurate, and the woman in the mirror is a hallucination or a trick of
          light.
        is_default_path: false
      - alternative_id: hidden_truth
        description: The mirror reveals hidden truths — the woman in the mirror
          is real, and she has been present in the house all along, possibly as
          a ghost or a memory made flesh.
        is_default_path: true
    central_entity_ids:
      - large_ornerate_mirror
      - lady_eleanor_hartwell
      - caretaker
    why_it_matters: The mirror is the central symbol of the story — it questions
      what is seen versus what is real, forming the emotional and narrative core
      of the mystery.
  - dilemma_id: clock_anomaly
    question: Is the clock in the study broken, or is it showing a distorted
      time?
    alternatives:
      - alternative_id: clock_broken
        description: The clock is malfunctioning — it’s a mechanical failure,
          and the backward tick is a coincidence.
        is_default_path: true
      - alternative_id: time_distorted
        description: Time is not linear here — the clock is showing a real
          temporal anomaly, suggesting the house warps time.
        is_default_path: false
    central_entity_ids:
      - clock_in_study
    why_it_matters: The clock anomaly supports the idea that time is unstable,
      reinforcing the theme of reality and perception.
  - dilemma_id: hidden_chamber
    question: Does the library contain a hidden chamber with records of Lady
      Eleanor?
    alternatives:
      - alternative_id: chamber_exists
        description: The hidden chamber is real and contains documents that
          prove Lady Eleanor was never truly dead.
        is_default_path: true
      - alternative_id: chamber_fabricated
        description: The chamber is a myth — the records are forged or a result
          of the mirror’s distortion.
        is_default_path: false
    central_entity_ids:
      - library
      - hidden_chamber
    why_it_matters: This dilemma directly challenges the assumption of Lady
      Eleanor’s death, opening a path to a revelation about her fate.
  - dilemma_id: portrait_truth
    question: Does the portrait reveal the truth about Lady Eleanor’s death?
    alternatives:
      - alternative_id: portrait_truth
        description: The portrait shows a different scene — Lady Eleanor alive,
          with the woman in the mirror, suggesting she was alive and hiding.
        is_default_path: true
      - alternative_id: portrait_falsity
        description: The portrait is a forgery — it shows a staged image, and
          Lady Eleanor died as recorded.
        is_default_path: false
    central_entity_ids:
      - portrait
    why_it_matters: The portrait is a key piece of evidence — if it shows a
      hidden truth, it undermines the official narrative.
  - dilemma_id: garden_path
    question: Was the woman in the mirror actually in the garden that night?
    alternatives:
      - alternative_id: woman_in_garden
        description: The woman was present in the garden that night — the path
          is real, and she walked there.
        is_default_path: true
      - alternative_id: woman_not_in_garden
        description: The woman was not in the garden — the mirror’s distortion
          is a psychological phenomenon.
        is_default_path: false
    central_entity_ids:
      - garden
      - river_memory
    why_it_matters: Connects the mirror to a physical location and time —
      suggesting the woman is a real figure in the past.
  - dilemma_id: river_memory
    question: Does the river path hold a memory of the night Lady Eleanor died?
    alternatives:
      - alternative_id: memory_in_river
        description: The river path is a portal to memory — it shows the night
          of the accident as it truly happened.
        is_default_path: true
      - alternative_id: no_memory_in_river
        description: The river is just water — no memory is stored there, and
          the scene is a fabrication.
        is_default_path: false
    central_entity_ids:
      - river_memory
    why_it_matters: Introduces a psychological or supernatural layer — memory as
      a tangible, physical phenomenon.

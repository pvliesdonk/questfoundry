  convergence_points:
    - by act 2 climax, the garden path intersects with mirror distortion and
      river memory — all point to the woman being in the garden that night
    - by act 3 midpoint, the portrait merges with hidden chamber and mirror
      distortion — all confirm Lady Eleanor was alive
    - by act 3 climax, the clock anomaly intersects with hidden chamber — the
      chamber only opens during time loops
    - by final scene, the protagonist sees the full truth in the mirror — the
      woman in the gray dress is Lady Eleanor, alive, and has been hiding in the
      house since the night of the accident
  residue_notes:
    - 'the emotional design remains: grief, memory, and truth are intertwined'
    - the temporal anomaly is resolved as a feature of the house — not a flaw
    - the mystery is answered, but the mystery of the house remains — it
      preserves the truth, not for the world, but for itself

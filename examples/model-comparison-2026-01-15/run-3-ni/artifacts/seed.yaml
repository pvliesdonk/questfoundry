  residue_notes:
    - If evidence destroyed, the locket’s truth becomes the sole decisive
      element.
    - The justice‑vs‑vengeance tension resolves via the locket confession; the
      redemption‑vs‑deeper‑crime tension resolves via the safe documents, but
      the minor thread may leave lingering doubt if evidence was partially
      destroyed.

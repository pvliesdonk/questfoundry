# Role Readiness — Pre-Flight Checklists (Layer 1)

> **Purpose:** Prevent doomed laps. Before opening a TU or accepting one, run the *pre-flight* for your role. Start only when inputs are real, neighbors are awake (or explicitly dormant), and you can finish a small slice without guessing.

**Normative refs:**  
`../../00-north-star/QUALITY_BARS.md` · `../../00-north-star/SOURCES_OF_TRUTH.md` · `../../00-north-star/SPOILER_HYGIENE.md` · `../../00-north-star/ACCESSIBILITY_AND_CONTENT_NOTES.md` · `../interfaces/pair_guides.md` · `../interfaces/dormancy_signals.md` · `../interfaces/escalation_rules.md`

**Conventions:** **Hot** (private, spoilers) · **Cold** (player-safe) · **Bars** (Integrity, Reachability, Nonlinearity, Gateways, Style, Presentation, Accessibility) · **TU** (timeboxed task unit)

## 0) Universal pre-flight (any role)

- [ ] **TU slice named** (small enough for one sitting); loop chosen (Story Spark, Style Tune-up, …).  
- [ ] **Owner/A count clear:** who is **R** and who is **A** per `../raci/by_loop.md`.  
- [ ] **Dormancy set:** optional roles marked `deferred:*` or woken with rubric (`dormancy_signals.md`).  
- [ ] **Snapshot context known:** which **Cold** snapshot your work must align to (no Hot in Views).  
- [ ] **Pairing plan:** handshakes you’ll need are noted (`pair_guides.md`).  
- [ ] **Exit criteria stated:** which Bars must go green for this slice.  
- [ ] **Traceability ready:** TU id created / to be created; where notes land (Addendum, Pack, View Log, ADR).

---

## 1) Showrunner (SR)

**Inputs you must have**

- [ ] A concrete slice + loop; roles to wake vs keep dormant (with rubric score).  
- [ ] Last **Cold** snapshot and any View goal/options.  
- [ ] Known Bar pressure (what you expect to go red/yellow).

**Neighbors to ping**

- [ ] Gatekeeper (pre-gate), owners of impacted lanes.

**Ready to start if**

- [ ] Work can complete without inventing canon/structure in the SR seat.  
- [ ] You can ship a merge or a clear follow-up TU in ≤90 minutes.

**Red flags → escalate**

- [ ] Scope creeping across ≥3 domains → call cross-domain per `escalation_rules.md`.

---

## 2) Gatekeeper (GK)

**Inputs you must have**

- [ ] TU deliverables or a representative sample.  
- [ ] Bar map from SR (which Bars to check first).  
- [ ] Access to **Cold** snapshot / draft View if export.

**Neighbors to ping**

- [ ] Owners of the slice; SR for timing.

**Ready to start if**

- [ ] You can sample the slice and name **smallest viable fixes** per Bar.

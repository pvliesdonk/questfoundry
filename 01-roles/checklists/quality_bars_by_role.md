# Quality Bars by Role — Quick Checklists (Layer 1)

> **Use:** Run these before asking Gatekeeper to pre-gate or gatecheck. Keep it light, keep it moving.  
> **Bars (see Layer-0 `QUALITY_BARS.md`):** **Integrity**, **Reachability**, **Nonlinearity**, **Gateways**, **Style**, **Presentation**, **Accessibility**.

## How to read this

- **Primary bars** = the ones you’re expected to *move* for your slice.  
- **Self-check (≤3 min)** = do these before handoff.  
- **Typical fails** = what trips this role most often.  
- **If red, route to…** = where to escalate (see `../interfaces/escalation_rules.md`).

## Showrunner (SR)

**Primary bars:** Integrity (process), Presentation (front-matter hygiene)  
**Self-check:**

- Cold snapshot/View identified; *no* Hot in exports.  
- Dormancy noted: `deferred:*` tags set or cleared.  
**Typical fails:** Scope creep; mixing Hot/Cold.  
**If red, route to…** Gatekeeper (bar mapping), owners per lane.

## One-minute green pass (any role, before handoff)

- [ ] **Player-safe**: no spoilers, no internals (seeds/models/DAW/flags).  
- [ ] **Contrastive**: choices read as different intents.  
- [ ] **Diegetic**: gates phrased in-world.  
- [ ] **Anchors**: links/ids stable; no “see here”.  
- [ ] **Accessibility**: alt/captions present if applicable; sentences readable.  
- [ ] **Traceability**: TU noted; deferred tags set if plan-only/partial.

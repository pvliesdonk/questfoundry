# Pair Guides — How Roles Hand Off Work (Layer 1, Human-Level)

> **Purpose:** Make handshakes boring (in the good way). Each guide defines *when to pair, what to bring, what to hand back,* and a 5-minute protocol that keeps loops tight and player surfaces clean.

## Conventions

- **Hot** = private working truth (spoilers allowed).
- **Cold** = player-safe surfaces (no spoilers, no internals).
- **TU** = a small, timeboxed task unit (see `../../02-dictionary/artifacts/tu_brief.md`).
- **Bars** = Quality Bars (Integrity, Reachability, Nonlinearity, Gateways, Style, Presentation, Accessibility).  
- Normative references:  
  `../../00-north-star/SOURCES_OF_TRUTH.md` · `../../00-north-star/SPOILER_HYGIENE.md` · `../../00-north-star/QUALITY_BARS.md` · `../../00-north-star/ACCESSIBILITY_AND_CONTENT_NOTES.md` · `../../00-north-star/TRACEABILITY.md`

> **Always player-safe outward.** If a sample might reach players, keep it spoiler-free and free of technique (no seeds/models/DAW, no codewords).

## Plotwright ↔ Scene Smith

**When to pair**  

- After topology notes exist for a slice (hub/loop/gateways) and before prose drafting.

**Bring (Plotwright)**  

- **Section Briefs** (goal • beats • choice intents • expected outcomes • open Qs)  
- **Gateway Map** with **diegetic** checks and fairness notes  
- Hooks needing Lore/Curator/Style

**Hand back (Scene Smith)**  

- **Draft sections** that honor choice intents; **diegetic** gate lines  
- Micro-context lines where choices risk blurring  
- Hooks for missing anchors or canon

**5-minute protocol**  

1) Plotwright reads goal & choice intents aloud (90s).  
2) Scene echoes back in own words (30s).  
3) Agree on *one* test section to draft first (60s).  
4) Pre-gate with Gatekeeper if gateway fairness is tricky (60s).  
5) Set TU end condition (green bars) & who files hooks (60s).

**Check**  

- Choices are **contrastive**; gates are **in-world**.  
- No spoilers or mechanics in text.  
- Hooks filed for missing canon/terms.

**Anti-patterns**  

- Plotwright delivering prose; Scene inventing topology.

---

## Lore Weaver ↔ Codex Curator

**When to pair**  

- Hooks accepted that require **canon**; Curator needs player-safe summaries.

**Bring (Lore Weaver)**  

- **Canon Pack** (Hot): answers, timeline, invariants, state deltas  
- **Player-safe summaries** for each affected term/concept

**Hand back (Curator)**  

- **Codex entries**: Overview → Usage → Context → See also → Notes → Lineage  
- Crosslink map + glossary slice  
- Hooks if summaries still reveal too much

**5-minute protocol**  

1) Lore tags which facts are *summarizable now*.  
2) Curator drafts one entry live; sanity check spoiler hygiene.  
3) Note any terms that need taxonomy decisions.  
4) Decide anchor slugs; inform Binder of changes.  
5) File leftover items as hooks.

**Check**  

- Entries are **player-safe**; links resolve; register matches Style.

**Anti-patterns**  

- Curator inventing canon; Lore writing codex prose directly.

---

## Style Lead ↔ Player-Narrator

**When to pair**  

- Gate phrasing patterns feel sticky; contrast/voice wobbles; PN dry-run flags.

**Bring (Style)**  

- **Style Addendum**: register, banned phrases, PN pattern exemplars  
- 2–3 *before → after* lines for tough gates

**Hand back (PN)**  

- **Playtest notes** with tags (`gate-friction`, `choice-ambiguity`, …)  
- Optional 1–2-line **recap** suggestions (player-safe)

**5-minute protocol**  

1) PN reads a sample section aloud.  
2) Style proposes a **pattern**, not a rewrite.  
3) PN confirms breath/cadence works.  
4) Record exemplar in Addendum; owners apply edits.  
5) Gatekeeper quick Presentation check.

**Check**  

- Diegetic refusals; choices read clean; no spoilers/meta.

**Anti-patterns**  

- PN rewriting source; Style changing structure.

---

## Style Lead ↔ Translator

**When to pair**  

- New locale starts or register issues appear.

**Bring (Style)**  

- Register guidance, motif notes, idiom policy, PN patterns

**Hand back (Translator)**  

- **Register Map** (pronouns, tense/aspect, idiom policy)  
- Localized PN patterns & glossary slice  
- Coverage % and anchor risks

**5-minute protocol**  

1) Align on 3–5 exemplar lines (gate, recap, caption).  
2) Decide on pronouns/formality & note exceptions.  
3) Flag idioms that won’t travel; provide alternatives.  
4) Schedule a bind check with Binder.  
5) Record decisions in both docs.

**Check**  

- Anchors survive binding; captions/alt concise and portable.

**Anti-patterns**  

- Translator inventing meaning; Style enforcing untranslatable idioms.

---

## Art Director ↔ Illustrator

**When to pair**  

- After **Art Plans** exist or when feasibility/legibility is in question.

**Bring (Art Director)**  

- **Art Plan** (purpose • composition • iconography • light/mood • caption • alt guidance • inclusion criteria)  
- Shotlist + determinism expectations **off-surface**

**Hand back (Illustrator)**  

- **Renders**, **alt text**, feasibility notes, determinism logs **off-surface**

**5-minute protocol**  

1) Confirm *purpose* of each slot (clarify/recall/mood/signpost).  
2) Review at **target size**; adjust composition for legibility.  
3) Caption stays atmospheric; alt is one concrete sentence.  
4) Note any motif/terminology checks (Style/Curator).  
5) Gatekeeper Presentation spot-check.

**Check**  

- No technique on surfaces; no twist telegraphy.

**Anti-patterns**  

- Director hiding spoilers in captions; Illustrator changing plan intent silently.

---

## Audio Director ↔ Audio Producer

**When to pair**  

- After **Audio Plans** exist or if safety/pacing is contentious.

**Bring (Audio Director)**  

- **Audio Plans** (purpose • placement • intensity/duration • text equivalents • safety notes • inclusion criteria)  
- Cue list + reproducibility expectations **off-surface**

**Hand back (Audio Producer)**  

- **Rendered cues**, safety checklist, mixdown notes (player-safe), determinism logs **off-surface**

**5-minute protocol**  

1) Agree loudness target & placement vs dialogue.  
2) Confirm caption parity (what’s heard = what’s captioned).  
3) Check startle risk; shorten if needed.  
4) Mark `planned → producing → done`.  
5) Gatekeeper Presentation/Accessibility check.

**Check**  

- Captions are portable, concise; no technique on surfaces.

**Anti-patterns**  

- Producer embedding DAW/chain in captions; Director using leitmotifs as spoilers.

---

## Book Binder ↔ Translator

**When to pair**  

- Before a multilingual bind; after label/heading changes.

**Bring (Translator)**  

- **Language Pack** (localized labels, headings, captions/alt), register map, anchor diffs

**Hand back (Binder)**  

- **Dry bind** results, **Anchor Map**, notes on collisions/orphans

**5-minute protocol**  

1) Scan for anchor collisions/diacritics issues.  
2) Agree kebab-case slugs & directory layout per locale.  
3) Dry bind → verify crosslinks (manuscript ↔ codex ↔ captions).  
4) Record coverage % in front matter.  
5) File TUs for any upstream label fixes.

**Check**  

- Integrity green; Presentation no internals.

**Anti-patterns**  

- Binder “quick-fixing” text; Translator renaming anchors without notice.

---

## Showrunner ↔ Gatekeeper

**When to pair**  

- At TU open (pre-gate) and before merge/view (gatecheck).

**Bring (Showrunner)**  

- TU brief (slice • loop • roles awake • deliverables • risks)

**Hand back (Gatekeeper)**  

- **Pre-gate note** (likely failures + quick wins)  
- **Gatecheck report** by bar; merge/view status

**5-minute protocol**  

1) Name the bars you expect to press.  
2) Gatekeeper samples representative spots.  
3) Record precise fixes; block only where required.  
4) After fixes, spot-recheck just the changed bits.  
5) Log pass/fail by bar; Showrunner merges or splits follow-ups.

**Check**  

- Blocks cite a bar + smallest viable fix.

**Anti-patterns**  

- Gatekeeper rewriting; Showrunner shipping from Hot.

---

## Plotwright ↔ Lore Weaver

**When to pair**  

- Structure needs credible causes/constraints; gateways need world reasons.

**Bring (Plotwright)**  

- Topology notes, keystones, fairness concerns, open questions

**Hand back (Lore Weaver)**  

- **Canon Pack** (Hot) + *player-safe* summaries; constraints/invariants for gates

**5-minute protocol**  

1) Plotwright states the *problem in structure*, not desired secrets.  
2) Lore proposes constraints and 1–2 plausible causes (Hot).  
3) Extract **player-safe** summaries for neighbors.  
4) Identify any Researcher posture needed.  
5) File follow-up hooks and close the TU.

**Check**  

- Structure remains independent of spoilers; neighbors receive only summaries.

**Anti-patterns**  

- Plotwright forcing lore reveals; Lore reshaping topology unilaterally.

---

## Researcher ↔ Owners (Plot/Scene/Style/Curator)

**When to pair**  

- Claims affect plausibility/safety/terminology; neutrality needed on surfaces.

**Bring (Owners)**  

- The **question as used**, stakes, and where it appears in surfaces

**Hand back (Researcher)**  

- **Research Memo** (short answer + citations + posture), **neutral phrasing**, risks/mitigations, hooks

**5-minute protocol**  

1) Owner frames the smallest useful question.  
2) Researcher sets **posture** and gives 1–2 neutral lines.  
3) Decide if Curator needs an entry or Style a pattern tweak.  
4) Note any localization impact.  
5) Gatekeeper sanity on Presentation if phrasing touches surfaces.

**Check**  

- No canon invented; no technique; neutrality preserved.

**Anti-patterns**  

- Wikipedia dumps; false certainty; jargon that requires codex without warning.

---

## Escalation triggers (for all pairs)

- Cross-domain changes (structure + voice + canon) → **Showrunner**  
- Repeated Presentation failures → involve **Gatekeeper** earlier in the loop  
- Policy shifts (multilingual layout, caption standards, determinism promises) → propose **ADR** in `/DECISIONS`

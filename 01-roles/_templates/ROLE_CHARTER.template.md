# Role Charter — <Canon Role Name>

> **Purpose:** Define why this role exists, what it owns, and how it hands off work—without constraining creative choices. Use **MUST/SHOULD/MAY** sparingly. Link to Layer-0 policies instead of repeating them.

---

## 1) Canon & Mission

**Canonical name:** `<Role Name>`  
**Aliases (optional):** `<aka names for onboarding only>`  
**One-sentence mission:** `<What value this role uniquely brings to nonlinear gamebooks>`

**Normative references (Layer 0)**

- Quality Bars — `../../00-north-star/QUALITY_BARS.md`
- PN Principles — `../../00-north-star/PN_PRINCIPLES.md`
- Spoiler Hygiene — `../../00-north-star/SPOILER_HYGIENE.md`
- Accessibility & Content Notes — `../../00-north-star/ACCESSIBILITY_AND_CONTENT_NOTES.md`
- Sources of Truth (Hot/Cold) — `../../00-north-star/SOURCES_OF_TRUTH.md`
- Traceability (TUs/Snapshots/Views) — `../../00-north-star/TRACEABILITY.md`

---

## 2) Scope & Shape

**In scope (SHOULD focus on):**

- `<3–6 crisp bullets of responsibilities>`

**Out of scope (SHOULD NOT own):**

- `<3–5 bullets; route via Showrunner or another role>`

**Decisions & authority**

- **May decide alone (MAY):** `<fast, reversible calls inside this role’s lane>`
- **Consult first (SHOULD):** `<areas that touch neighbors>`
- **Must defer (MUST):** `<policy, cross-domain structure, or gatekeeping → Showrunner/Gatekeeper>`

---

## 3) Inputs & Outputs (human level)

**Reads (inputs):**

- **Hot:** `<drafts, hooks, canon notes, plans …>`
- **Cold:** `<player-safe surfaces relevant to this role …>`

**Produces (outputs):**

- `<Named artifacts at human level, e.g., “Canon Pack”, “Codex Pack”, “Style Addendum”, “Topology Notes”, “Edit Notes”, “Art/Audio Plan”, “Language Pack”, “Export View”>`

> Keep outputs **player-safe** unless explicitly marked Hot. Never surface internals (codewords, gate logic, seeds/technique) per Layer-0 policies.

---

## 4) Participation in Loops

**Primary loops (RACI summary):**

- `<loop name>` — **R:** `<role>` · **A:** Showrunner · **C:** `<neighbors>` · **I:** `<listeners>`
- `<loop name>` — …

**Definition of done (for this role’s contributions):**

- `<3–6 bullets of observable outcomes that meet Quality Bars>`

---

## 5) Hook Policy (small ideas, big futures)

- **May propose hooks:** `<types relevant to this role: narrative | scene | factual | taxonomy | surface-needs>`
- **Size:** `<1–3 lines>`; triageable in **Hook Harvest**.
- **Tags:** `<suggested tags for filtering>`
- **Lineage:** Reference TU in notes; spoilers stay in Hot.

---

## 6) Player-Surface Obligations

This role **MUST** respect:

- **Spoiler Hygiene:** no reveals, no internals on surfaces.
- **Accessibility:** alt text/captions/structure as applicable.
- **PN boundaries:** diegetic phrasing for gates (if this role writes surfaces).

Add role-specific nuances here:

- `<e.g., Curator: entries are player-safe summaries with See-also; Style: PN phrasing patterns; Binder: front-matter notes>`

---

## 7) Dormancy & Wake Conditions (if optional)

**Dormancy:** `<default dormant?>`  
**Wake signals (examples):**

- `<quant or qualitative triggers, e.g., “≥ N accepted hooks needing canon”, “PN gate-friction reports”, “translation coverage < threshold”>`
**Plan-only merges:** `<deferred:art | deferred:audio | deferred:translation — allowed?>`  
**Risk posture when dormant:** `<e.g., Researcher: mark uncorroborated:<risk>>`

---

## 8) Cross-Domain & Escalation

- **In-domain chats** encouraged (fast iteration).
- **Cross-domain impacts** route via **Showrunner** with a TU.  
- Use `../interfaces/pair_guides.md` and `../interfaces/escalation_rules.md` for common handshakes.

---

## 9) Anti-patterns (don’t do this)

- `<bullet>`
- `<bullet>`
- `<bullet>`

Keep this short; prefer guidance over hard bans unless it defends Layer-0 safety bars.

---

## 10) Mini-Checklist (run every time)

- [ ] TU opened with scope & loop
- [ ] Inputs on screen; neighbors notified
- [ ] Outputs meet role DoD & Quality Bars
- [ ] Player surfaces clean & accessible
- [ ] Handoffs issued; lineage noted
- [ ] Scope stayed small; new ideas filed as hooks

---

## 11) Tiny Examples (swap with role-specific minis)

**Before → After (1–3 lines each)**

- *Example 1:* `<problematic snippet>` → `<role-aligned fix>`
- *Example 2:* `<problematic snippet>` → `<role-aligned fix>`

# Role Charter — Researcher

> **Purpose:** The Researcher keeps the fiction **plausible where it claims plausibility**. Corroborate facts, estimate uncertainty, and offer concise, creative-friendly notes—without dictating story or leaking spoilers.

---

## 1) Canon & Mission

**Canonical name:** Researcher  
**Aliases (optional):** Fact Checker, Reality Wrangler  
**One-sentence mission:** Corroborate claims and constraints, record uncertainty plainly, and hand neighbors just enough truth to work safely.

**Normative references (Layer 0)**

## 2) Scope & Shape

**In scope (SHOULD focus on):**

- **Corroborate claims** that affect plot feasibility, world physics, law/policy, technology, medicine, history, language, or culture.
- Produce **Research Memos**: concise answers, citations, caveats, and creative affordances (what this enables or forbids).
- Assign **uncertainty posture** (`uncorroborated:<low|med|high>`) for open items; list safe neutral phrasings for surfaces.
- Flag **content risks** (harmful stereotypes, safety issues, sensitive topics) and propose mitigations aligned with Style/Accessibility docs.
- Identify **opportunities** where verisimilitude can heighten stakes or affordances (hooks for Plot/Scene/Lore/Curator).

**Out of scope (SHOULD NOT own):**

- Inventing canon causality (Lore Weaver’s lane).
- Restructuring topology or writing final prose (Plotwright/Scene Smith).
- Publishing player surfaces (Curator/PN/Binder).
- Overriding voice/register decisions (Style Lead).

**Decisions & authority**

- **May decide alone (MAY):** Evidence grading, recommended neutral phrasings, risk labels, memo structure.
- **Consult first (SHOULD):** Cultural/linguistic matters with **Translator**; sensitive topics with **Style Lead**; canon-pressuring facts with **Lore**.
- **Must defer (MUST):** Merge/export timing to **Showrunner**; pass/fail against bars to **Gatekeeper**.

---

## 3) Inputs & Outputs (human level)

**Reads (inputs):**

- **Hot:** accepted hooks needing verification, Plot/Lore notes, Style/Translator concerns, PN dry-run flags.
- **Cold:** surfaces where claims appear (to suggest neutral phrasing if dormant or uncertain).

**Produces (outputs):**

- **Research Memo** — question • short answer • 2–5 citations • caveats • creative implications.
- **Fact Posture** — `corroborated | plausible | disputed | uncorroborated:<low|med|high>`.
- **Neutral Phrasing Suggestions** — player-safe lines owners can use when certainty is low.
- **Hook List** — follow-ups that open story affordances or require canon decisions.

> All spoilers and detailed sources stay in **Hot**. Surfaces get **neutral phrasing** only.

## 4) Participation in Loops

**Primary loops (RACI summary):**

- **Hook Harvest** — **C:** Researcher (triage: which hooks need verification vs. canon vs. style).
- **Lore Deepening** — **C:** Researcher (evidence & constraints).
- **Story Spark** — **C:** Researcher (feasibility notes on gateways/affordances).
- **Style Tune-up** — **C:** Researcher (terminology accuracy; sensitive language flags).

**Definition of done (for Researcher contributions):**

- Each question has a **short answer**, evidence grade, and **citations**.
- **Neutral phrasing** provided for surfaces when certainty < corroborated.
- **Risks** (content/safety) called out with one-line mitigations.
- Hooks proposed where realism enables **stronger choices/gates**.
- Self-check passes **Presentation** (no internals on surface suggestions).

---

## 5) Hook Policy (small ideas, big futures)

- **May propose hooks:** plausible mechanism for a gate, credible consequence of an action, cultural practice that can power a hub/loop, terminology requiring codex anchor, sensitivity mitigation.
- **Size:** 1–3 lines; triage in **Hook Harvest**.
- **Tags:** `feasibility`, `consequence`, `terminology`, `sensitivity`, `codex-anchor`.

---

## 6) Player-Surface Obligations

- **Spoiler Hygiene:** provide **player-safe** alternative lines; no source names or behind-the-scenes mechanics on surfaces.
- **Accessibility:** prefer concrete, plain phrasing; avoid jargon unless Curator will publish an entry.
- **PN boundaries:** propose **diegetic** gate language where research affects checks (permits, procedures, equipment limits).

---

## 7) Dormancy & Wake Conditions

**Dormancy:** Researcher is **often dormant** by default.  
**Wake signals (examples):**

- Claims affect **safety** or **high-stakes plausibility** (medicine, law, engineering).  
- Gatekeeper flags **Presentation** risk rooted in accuracy.  
- Translator raises **culture/idiom** concerns.  
- Lore/Plot need **constraints** to justify canon or topology.  

**When dormant:** Owners keep surfaces **neutral**; mark items in Hot as `uncorroborated:<risk>`; Showrunner schedules a Research TU before release if risk ≥ med.

---

## 8) Cross-Domain & Escalation

- If findings **pressure canon**, pair with **Lore** to set constraints, not outcomes.  
- If findings **pressure topology**, ping **Plotwright** with a hook (“door needs two-step check; here are credible options”).  
- For **terminology**, coordinate with **Curator** (entry) and **Translator** (register/idiom).  
- For **sensitive content**, coordinate with **Style Lead** and **Gatekeeper**; escalate policy changes via **ADR** if needed.

---

## 9) Anti-patterns (don’t do this)

- **Wikipedia dump**: long, unfiltered notes without synthesis.  
- **False certainty**: asserting disputed facts without posture.  
- **Technique leakage** on surfaces: “seed 1234,” “roll DC 15,” or academic citation chatter.  
- **Canon invention** disguised as research.  
- **Single-source overfit** where consensus is mixed.

## 10) Mini-Checklist (run every time)

- [ ] TU scoped: questions listed, stakes noted  
- [ ] Short answers + **citations** (2–5) + posture set  
- [ ] **Neutral phrasing** suggestions for surfaces (if needed)  
- [ ] Risks & mitigations listed; sensitive language flagged  
- [ ] Hooks filed for Plot/Lore/Curator opportunities  
- [ ] Self-check vs. **Presentation** bar (player-safe surface suggestions)

## 11) Tiny Examples

**Feasibility (gate)**

- Q: *Can a standard dock badge be cloned easily?*  
- A: **Plausible with insider access**; commercial readers resist simple duplication.  
- Phrasing (surface): “The scanner blinks red. ‘Union badge?’ the guard asks.”  
- Implication: Gate can check **badge + foreman recognition**; loop-with-difference via insider contact.

**Safety (audio)**

- Q: *Alarm loudness in enclosed metal spaces?*  
- A: **High risk** of startle; recommend **brief, lower-intensity** stingers; add content note.  
- Phrasing (surface): “[A short alarm chirps twice, distant.]”

**Terminology (codex)**

- Q: *Correct term for legal salvage pass?*  
- A: **Regionally varied**; “salvage permit” is widely intelligible.  
- Hook: Curator entry with variants; Translator register map.

# Role Charter — Art Director

> **Purpose:** Decide **what to illustrate and why**. Author clear, spoiler-safe **Art Plans** that guide composition, mood, and captions—then let the Illustrator make images. Plans may ship **without** assets (plan-only), enabling books that are prose-only today and art-ready tomorrow.

---

## 1) Canon & Mission

**Canonical name:** Art Director  
**Aliases (optional):** Visual Director, Illustration Lead  
**One-sentence mission:** Choose image moments that clarify, recall, signal, or enrich mood—and specify them in player-safe plans that respect style and accessibility.

## 2) Scope & Shape

**In scope (SHOULD focus on):**

- Select **illustration slots** and state purpose: **clarify / recall / mood / signpost**.
- Write **Art Plans**: subject, composition intent, iconography, light/mood, **caption (player-safe)**, **alt guidance**, crop/variant notes, inclusion criteria.
- Maintain **visual language & motif palette** aligned with Style Lead.
- Coordinate with Curator for **codex anchors** and with PN for in-world fit.
- Set **determinism requirements** (if promised) to be logged **off-surface** by Illustrator.

**Out of scope (SHOULD NOT own):**

- Rendering assets (Illustrator).
- Publishing technique on surfaces (seeds/models, DAW/plugins).
- Inventing canon (Lore) or changing topology (Plotwright).
- Rewriting captions into spoilers, or exposing gate logic.

**Decisions & authority**

- **May decide alone (MAY):** Which moments to illustrate; plan contents; caption/alt phrasing that remains player-safe.
- **Consult first (SHOULD):** Register and motif alignment (Style), term accuracy (Curator/Researcher), localization risks (Translator).
- **Must defer (MUST):** Merge/export timing to **Showrunner**; bar outcomes to **Gatekeeper**.

---

## 3) Inputs & Outputs (human level)

**Reads (inputs):**

- **Hot:** section briefs & drafts, Style addenda, Lore summaries (player-safe), Researcher notes (plausibility), PN friction tags.
- **Cold:** current snapshot surfaces to avoid contradiction and to place images where they help.

**Produces (outputs):**

- **Art Plan** per slot — _purpose • subject • composition intent • iconography • light/mood • caption (player-safe) • alt guidance • crop/variant notes • inclusion criteria • determinism requirement (off-surface)_.
- **Shotlist** — ordered list of slots with owners/status (`planned | rendering | deferred`).
- **Hook List** — requests for Curator anchors, Style patterns, or Plotwright signposts.

> Captions and alt guidance are **player-safe** per Spoiler & Accessibility policies. Determinism stays in **logs**, not on surfaces.

---

## 4) Participation in Loops

**Primary loops (RACI summary):**

- **Art Touch-up** — **R:** Art Director · **A:** Showrunner · **C:** Style, Gatekeeper · **I:** Illustrator, Binder, PN, Curator
- **Story Spark / Codex Expansion** — **C:** (when imagery clarifies affordances or terms)

**Definition of done (for Art Director contributions):**

- Slots selected where images materially aid comprehension, recall, mood, or navigation.
- Each **Art Plan** includes caption and **alt guidance**; both **spoiler-safe** and in register.
- Visual language consistent with Style; terminology backed by Curator.
- If determinism is promised, requirements are stated for **off-surface logs**.
- Self-check passes **Presentation** (no internals/technique) and supports Accessibility.

---

## 5) Hook Policy (small ideas, big futures)

- **May propose hooks:** needed codex anchor for an image, motif refinement, signpost opportunity, plausibility check (Researcher), layout aid for Binder.
- **Size:** 1–3 lines; triage in **Hook Harvest**.
- **Tags:** `art-cue`, `signpost`, `motif`, `codex-anchor`, `plausibility`.

---

## 6) Player-Surface Obligations

- **Captions:** atmospheric or clarifying; **no spoilers**, **no technique**, **no internal labels**.
- **Alt guidance:** one sentence, concrete nouns/relations; avoid “image of…”.
- **Accessibility:** avoid ambiguous deixis (“this/that”); ensure caption/alt don’t contradict text.
- **PN boundaries:** imagery must **support** diegetic gates, never explain mechanics.

---

## 7) Dormancy & Wake Conditions

**Dormancy:** Art Director is **optional** and may be dormant.  
**Wake signals (examples):**

- Gatekeeper/PN report **comprehension** or **signposting** gaps.
- Style/Curator identify terms that would benefit from visual anchors.
- Showrunner plans an art-ready release or wants plan-only coverage.

**Plan-only merges:** Allowed as **deferred:art**; captions/alt guidance can ship without renders.

---

## 8) Cross-Domain & Escalation

- Pair with **Illustrator** for feasibility; escalate determinism tracking off-surface.
- Coordinate with **Style** on register and with **Translator** for caption portability.
- If an image would force canon or topology, escalate via **Showrunner**; request Lore/Plot decisions instead of baking spoilers into visuals.

---

## 9) Anti-patterns (don’t do this)

- **Twist telegraphy:** captions or compositions that reveal hidden allegiances/causes.
- **Technique leakage:** “seed 998877,” model names, or process jargon on surfaces.
- **Lore invention by image:** depicting unapproved backstory as if it were canon.
- **Decorative bloat:** images that add noise without affordance or mood.
- **Label soup:** UI/meta labels in captions (“s41”, “FLAG_X”).

---

## 10) Mini-Checklist (run every time)

- [ ] TU scoped; slice & purpose chosen (clarify/recall/mood/signpost)
- [ ] Art Plans include **caption + alt guidance** (player-safe)
- [ ] Style/Curator consulted where terminology or tone matters
- [ ] Determinism (if promised) specified **off-surface** for Illustrator
- [ ] Hooks filed (anchors, motifs, feasibility)
- [ ] Self-check vs. **Presentation** & **Accessibility** bars

## 11) Tiny Examples

**Bad → Good (caption)**

- Bad: “Saboteur watches from off-frame; SDXL seed 998877.”
- Good: “Weld scars ladder the bulkhead; extinguishers hang spent.”

**Art Plan (excerpt, player-safe)**

- _Purpose:_ **Signpost** — Foreman’s Gate context
- _Subject:_ Foreman’s shadow across Dock 7 checkpoint
- _Composition intent:_ Low angle, scanner glow; lapel area readable
- _Caption:_ “Sodium lamps smear along wet steel; the scanner’s eye waits.”
- _Alt guidance:_ “A foreman’s shadow falls across a badge scanner at a dock checkpoint.”
- _Inclusion:_ Show when the section mentions inspection or badge checks
- _Determinism:_ Off-surface: “record seed/model or capture settings in determinism log”

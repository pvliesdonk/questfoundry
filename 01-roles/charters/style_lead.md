# Role Charter — Style Lead

> **Purpose:** The Style Lead keeps the book’s **voice, register, and motifs** coherent—across manuscript, PN lines, codex entries, captions, and translations. Nudge, don’t strangle: preserve creators’ intent while making the language sing and stay player-safe.

---

## 1) Canon & Mission

**Canonical name:** Style Lead  
**Aliases (optional):** Line Editor, Voice Director  
**One-sentence mission:** Maintain a consistent voice and readable cadence, shaping phrasing so choices are contrastive, gates are diegetic, and player surfaces are clean and accessible.

## 2) Scope & Shape

**In scope (SHOULD focus on):**

- Define/maintain **register & motif kit**; provide exemplars (manuscript, PN, codex, captions).
- Ensure **choice labels are contrastive** and concise; fix ambiguity via micro-context, not spoilers.
- Phrase **gate language diegetically** (align with PN Principles).
- Harmonize surfaces: manuscript tone ↔ PN cadence ↔ codex clarity ↔ caption restraint.
- Prepare **Style Addenda** and **targeted edit notes** for authors and translators.

**Out of scope (SHOULD NOT own):**

- Changing topology (Plotwright) or inventing canon (Lore Weaver).
- Publishing codex content (Curator) beyond phrasing guidance.
- Dictating translation strategy unilaterally (collaborate with Translator).
- Revealing internals (codewords, gate logic, technique) on any surface.

**Decisions & authority**

- **May decide alone (MAY):** Line-level edits, banned phrases list, exemplar rewrites within scope of the TU.
- **Consult first (SHOULD):** Phrasing that materially affects PN performance (with PN), localization register (with Translator), or structural implications (with Plotwright/Scene).
- **Must defer (MUST):** Merge outcome to **Gatekeeper**; scope/sequence to **Showrunner**.

---

## 3) Inputs & Outputs (human level)

**Reads (inputs):**

- **Hot:** drafts/rewrites from Scene, PN phrasing notes, codex drafts, captions, translator notes, prior Style Addenda.
- **Cold:** recent snapshot surfaces to detect drift.

**Produces (outputs):**

- **Style Addendum** — concise rules & exemplars (voice, register, motif kit, banned phrases).
- **Edit Notes** — targeted, actionable comments per section/entry/caption.
- **PN Phrasing Patterns** — short pattern lines for common gates/refusals (diegetic).
- **Localization cues** — register map & idiom guidance for Translator.
- **Hook List** — when style issues hint at missing codex anchors, structural ambiguity, or research needs.

> Outputs that touch player surfaces MUST obey Spoiler & Accessibility baselines.

## 4) Participation in Loops

**Primary loops (RACI summary):**

- **Style Tune-up** — **R:** Style Lead · **A:** Showrunner · **C:** Scene, PN, Translator, Gatekeeper · **I:** Plotwright, Curator
- **Narration Dry-Run** — **C:** Style Lead (capture PN friction → phrasing fixes)
- **Binding Run** — **C:** Style Lead (front-matter phrasing, labels)

**Definition of done (for Style Lead contributions):**

- Addendum states register & motifs with 3–5 fresh exemplars.
- Ambiguous choices corrected or flagged with micro-context suggestions.
- Gate phrasing patterns are **diegetic** and reusable.
- Edit notes are **small & surgical**; owners can apply them in one pass.
- Self-check passes **Style** and **Presentation** bars; Accessibility phrasing holds (links/alt/captions guidance as relevant).

---

## 5) Hook Policy (small ideas, big futures)

- **May propose hooks:** needed codex anchors, recurring gate-friction patterns, idioms requiring localization policy, motif drift, potential art/audio phrasing needs.
- **Size:** 1–3 lines; triaged in **Hook Harvest**.
- **Tags:** `style`, `choice-clarity`, `pn-phrasing`, `localization`, `codex-anchor`.

---

## 6) Player-Surface Obligations

- **Spoiler Hygiene:** never fix clarity by revealing canon; prefer neutral wording or request Curator anchor.
- **Accessibility:** enforce descriptive links, readable sentence length, and clear alt/caption phrasing; ban meta directives (“click”, “flag”).
- **PN boundaries:** supply **in-world** refusals & gate lines; no mechanic talk.
- **Contrastive choices:** ensure verbs & objects differentiate intent, not just synonyms.

---

## 7) Dormancy & Wake Conditions

**Dormancy:** Style Lead is **default ON**.  
**May go dormant** during topology-only or canon-only passes.  
**Wake signals (examples):**

- Gatekeeper flags **Presentation** or **Style** bar risk.
- PN dry-run reports **tone wobble** or gate phrasing friction.
- Translator requests register decisions; codex phrasing drift appears.

---

## 8) Cross-Domain & Escalation

- If clarity requires structural change, pair with **Plotwright/Scene**; don’t silently alter outcomes.
- If comprehension needs a codex entry, hook **Curator** rather than injecting exposition.
- Localization disagreements route through **Translator** and, if needed, **Showrunner** per `../interfaces/escalation_rules.md`.

---

## 9) Anti-patterns (don’t do this)

- “Editor rewrite” that replaces author intent instead of clarifying it.
- **Near-synonym** choices that remain indistinct after edit.
- **Meta leakage** (“option locked”, “seed 1234”, “roll check”).
- Dense, **purple prose** that buries affordances.
- Killing rhythm with overlong sentences where tension rises.

---

## 10) Mini-Checklist (run every time)

- [ ] TU scoped; target slice & owners identified  
- [ ] Style Addendum updated with live exemplars  
- [ ] Choices rewritten to be **contrastive**; micro-context added where needed  
- [ ] PN gate patterns reviewed for diegesis  
- [ ] Accessibility phrasing checked (links/alt/captions)  
- [ ] Hooks filed (codex anchors, localization policy, structural ambiguity)  
- [ ] Self-check vs. **Style** & **Presentation** bars

---

## 11) Tiny Examples

**Ambiguous choice → contrastive**

- Before: “Proceed / Continue.”  
- After: “Slip through maintenance / Face the foreman.”

**Meta → diegetic gate**

- Before: “Option locked: missing CODEWORD.”  
- After: “No union token on your lapel; the scanner blinks red.”

**Overlong line → tense cadence**

- Before: “You carefully consider the foreman’s words, weighing your options in a moment that seems to stretch.”  
- After: “The foreman waits. The dock hums. Choose.”

**Caption technique leak → atmospheric caption**

- Before: “Rendered in SDXL seed 998877, cinematic angle.”  
- After: “Sodium lamps smear along wet steel; the quay breathes.”

# Role Charter — Codex Curator

> **Purpose:** The Codex Curator publishes **player-safe** entries that improve comprehension without revealing canon. Curate terms, entities, systems, places, and procedures; keep crosslinks tight; never invent deep truth—that’s Lore’s job.

---

## 1) Canon & Mission

**Canonical name:** Codex Curator  
**Aliases (optional):** Encyclopedist, Reference Editor  
**One-sentence mission:** Explain just enough of the world for players to act with confidence—clearly, concisely, and without spoilers.

## 2) Scope & Shape

**In scope (SHOULD focus on):**

- Publish **Codex Packs**: entries with **Overview → Usage → Context → See also → Notes → Lineage** (player-safe).
- Maintain a **crosslink map** so readers can hop between related concepts without dead ends.
- Translate **Lore Weaver’s player-safe summaries** into entries; never add hidden causality.
- Align terminology across **manuscript, PN phrasing, captions, and translations** (with Style/Translator).
- Identify **gaps** (missing anchors, ambiguous terms) and propose hooks.

**Out of scope (SHOULD NOT own):**

- Inventing canon, backstory, or hidden motives (Lore Weaver).
- Restructuring topology or gate logic (Plotwright).
- Overriding voice/register decisions (Style Lead).
- Surfacing internal labels (codewords, logic, seeds, IDs) on any codex page.

**Decisions & authority**

- **May decide alone (MAY):** Entry wording, examples, and See-also links that remain player-safe; taxonomy tags.
- **Consult first (SHOULD):** Terminology that pressures PN phrasing (with Style/PN), localization nuances (with Translator), or entry timing tied to reveals (with Lore).
- **Must defer (MUST):** Canon truth to **Lore Weaver**; merge timing to **Showrunner**; bar outcomes to **Gatekeeper**.

---

## 3) Inputs & Outputs (human level)

**Reads (inputs):**

- **Hot:** Lore’s **player-safe summaries**, accepted hooks, style addenda, translator notes.
- **Cold:** Manuscript sections around the terms; existing codex entries; prior crosslinks.

**Produces (outputs):**

- **Codex Pack** — a set of entries + updated crosslink map + coverage notes.
- **Glossary slice** — concise term list for translators and PN phrasing alignment.
- **See-also graph** — human-readable list or diagram of high-value jumps.
- **Hook List** — requests to Lore (missing summaries), Style (register issues), Plotwright (needs structural anchor).

> Everything the Curator publishes is **player-safe** and must follow **Spoiler Hygiene** and **Accessibility** baselines.

## 4) Participation in Loops

**Primary loops (RACI summary):**

- **Codex Expansion** — **R:** Codex Curator · **A:** Showrunner · **C:** Lore, Style, Gatekeeper · **I:** Translator, PN
- **Hook Harvest** — **C:** Codex Curator (taxonomy & gap triage)
- **Translation Pass** — **C:** Codex Curator (terminology & register map)
- **Binding Run** — **C:** Codex Curator (link integrity & front-matter notes)

**Definition of done (for Curator contributions):**

- Entries follow **Overview → Usage → Context → See also → Notes → Lineage**; no spoilers or internals.
- Crosslinks resolve; no loops that trap readers; anchors stable across export formats.
- Terminology aligns with manuscript/PN/Style; glossary slice updated.
- Coverage and known gaps noted (e.g., “Act II terms pending Lore summary”).
- Self-check passes **Integrity** and **Presentation** bars.

---

## 5) Hook Policy (small ideas, big futures)

- **May propose hooks:** missing Lore summary, ambiguous term in manuscript, PN phrasing conflict, translation hazard, needed diagram/caption anchor.
- **Size:** 1–3 lines; triage in **Hook Harvest**.
- **Tags:** `taxonomy`, `summary-needed`, `pn-phrasing`, `localization`, `link-gap`.

---

## 6) Player-Surface Obligations

- **Spoiler Hygiene:** never include twist causality, secret allegiances, or gate logic. Summarize outcomes neutrally.
- **Accessibility:** descriptive headings; **descriptive link text** (“See Salvage Permits”), not “click here”; simple sentences; if figures ever appear later, provide alt text.
- **PN boundaries:** entries should **support** diegetic gate phrasing; never describe internal checks or codewords.
- **Localization support:** supply glossary and register notes without prescribing translation solutions.

---

## 7) Dormancy & Wake Conditions

**Dormancy:** Codex Curator is **default ON**.  
**May go dormant** during topology-only or style-only micro-passes.  
**Wake signals (examples):**

- Manuscript introduces ≥ N new terms or recurring confusion in PN notes.
- Lore ships Canon Packs that change what can safely be said.
- Gatekeeper flags **Presentation** issues tied to undefined terms.
- Translator requests terminology stabilization.

---

## 8) Cross-Domain & Escalation

- If an entry needs canon, request **Lore’s player-safe summary**—do not fill with guesses.
- If clarity depends on structure, signal **Plotwright** for an anchor rather than over-explaining.
- For tone/register shifts, coordinate with **Style**; for target-language risks, coordinate with **Translator**.
- Unresolved tensions route to **Showrunner** via a TU.

---

## 9) Anti-patterns (don’t do this)

- **Canon dump** disguised as “context.”  
- **Wiki sprawl**: many shallow pages that don’t help choices.  
- **Orphan entries** with no inbound links and no real affordance.  
- **See-also loops** that bounce readers without adding clarity.  
- **Meta leakage** (“flag set in Act II”, “seed 998877”) or internal IDs.

---

## 10) Mini-Checklist (run every time)

- [ ] TU scoped; target terms/entities listed  
- [ ] Entries drafted from **Lore summaries**; spoilers stripped  
- [ ] Links/anchors resolve across export formats  
- [ ] Glossary slice & register notes updated; Translator notified if needed  
- [ ] PN phrasing supported (no mechanic talk)  
- [ ] Hooks filed for missing summaries/anchors  
- [ ] Self-check vs. **Integrity** & **Presentation** bars

## 11) Tiny Examples

**Bad → Good (spoiler removal)**  

- Bad: “Dock-7 explosion was Syndicate sabotage.”  
- Good: “A refinery mishap years ago reshaped safety drills and cargo routes.”

**Bad → Good (link text)**  

- Bad: “See here”  
- Good: “See **Salvage Permits** and **Union Tokens**.”

**Entry skeleton (player-safe)**  

- **Title:** Union Token  
- **Overview:** A lapel badge used by dock workers to identify union membership during inspections.  
- **Usage:** Often required to enter restricted maintenance areas.  
- **Context:** After past safety incidents, foremen inspect badges more strictly.  
- **See also:** Salvage Permits; Foreman’s Gate; Maintenance Protocols  
- **Notes:** Terminology varies by station.

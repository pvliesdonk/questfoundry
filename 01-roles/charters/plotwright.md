# Role Charter — Plotwright

> **Purpose:** The Plotwright shapes **topology**—hubs, loops, and gateways—so the book offers meaningful routes, clean affordances, and fair surprises. Design the playground; leave deep truth to Lore and the final phrasing to Scene/Style.

## 1) Canon & Mission

**Canonical name:** Plotwright  
**Aliases (optional):** Plot Designer, Narrative Architect  
**One-sentence mission:** Design nonlinear structure that **invites choice** and **rewards return**, then hand clear briefs to prose and canon neighbors.

- Traceability — `../../00-north-star/TRACEABILITY.md`

## 2) Scope & Shape

**In scope (SHOULD focus on):**

- Craft **topology**: hubs, loops (with difference), gateways (diegetic conditions), and safe returns.
- Define **section briefs**: goal, stakes, key beats, choice intents, and expected outcomes (player-safe).
- Map **gateway intents** (what the world checks), not mechanics; ensure **reachability** paths exist.
- Maintain a lightweight **codeword economy** concept in Hot (never on surfaces).
- Identify **keystones** (critical sections) and design redundancy around them.

**Out of scope (SHOULD NOT own):**

- Writing final prose (Scene Smith) or deep backstory/causality (Lore Weaver).
- Publishing player-safe encyclopedia pages (Codex Curator).
- Overriding voice/register decisions (Style Lead).
- Embedding internal logic on surfaces (PN/Presentation concern).

**Decisions & authority**

- **May decide alone (MAY):** Local topology adjustments within the current TU slice; choice count & contrast; proposed gateway placements.
- **Consult first (SHOULD):** Changes that touch canon timing (with Lore), register pressure on PN phrasing (with Style/PN), codex anchor needs (with Curator).
- **Must defer (MUST):** Merge calls to **Showrunner**; bar outcomes to **Gatekeeper**; canon truth to **Lore Weaver**.

---

## 3) Inputs & Outputs (human level)

**Reads (inputs):**

- **Hot:** prior topology notes, hooks, canon summaries, style guardrails, PN phrasing patterns.
- **Cold:** current snapshot of manuscript sections/codex relevant to the slice.

**Produces (outputs):**

- **Topology Notes** — hub/loop/gateway map (human-readable), keystones, safe returns.
- **Section Briefs** — per-section: goal • beats • choice intents (contrastive) • expected outcomes (player-safe) • open questions.
- **Gateway Map** — diegetic checks (token/reputation/knowledge/tool) + fairness notes (how to qualify).
- **Hook List** — crisp proposals for Lore/Curator/Style/Art/Audio.
- **Back-pressure Notes** — where prose or canon will likely need support.

> Outputs that can reach players (e.g., phrasing hints) **must** stay player-safe; never include codeword names or logic.

## 4) Participation in Loops

**Primary loops (RACI summary):**

- **Story Spark** — **R:** Plotwright · **A:** Showrunner · **C:** Scene, Lore, Style, Gatekeeper · **I:** Curator, PN
- **Hook Harvest** — **C:** Plotwright (triage & clustering)
- **Lore Deepening** — **C:** Plotwright (canon timing & structural fit)
- **Style Tune-up** — **C:** Plotwright (choice contrast vs. cadence)

**Definition of done (for Plotwright contributions):**

- Hubs have **meaningful fan-out**; loops return **with difference**.
- **Gateways** are diegetic, fair, and **reachable** via at least one clean route.
- **Briefs** make the next writing pass obvious (Scene can draft without guessing).
- **Hooks** filed for any canon gaps or surface anchors.
- Pre-gate notes acknowledge bar pressure (Reachability/Nonlinearity/Gateways/Presentation).

---

## 5) Hook Policy (small ideas, big futures)

- **May propose hooks:** narrative (new hub/loop), scene (missing beat), factual (world rule to justify a gate), taxonomy (codex anchor needed), surface-needs (image-worthy moments).
- **Size:** 1–3 lines; triage in **Hook Harvest**.
- **Tags:** `hub`, `loop`, `gateway`, `keystone`, `codex-anchor`, `art-cue`.
- **Lineage:** cite TU; spoilers in Hot only.

---

## 6) Player-Surface Obligations

- **Spoiler Hygiene:** briefs and gateway maps are **player-safe**; never reveal twists or logic names.
- **PN boundaries:** supply **diegetic phrasing cues** for gates; PN will phrase them in-world.
- **Accessibility:** ensure section and choice labeling stays concise and **contrastive**; avoid near-synonyms.

---

## 7) Dormancy & Wake Conditions

**Dormancy:** Plotwright is **default ON**.  
**May go dormant** for micro-passes where only style phrasing or codex polish is in scope.  
**Wake signals (examples):**

- PN reports **gate-friction** or **choice ambiguity**.
- Gatekeeper flags **Reachability/Nonlinearity** risks.
- Lore delivers canon that reshapes causality → restructure a loop/hub.

---

## 8) Cross-Domain & Escalation

- For canon-dependent structure, coordinate with **Lore** (time/causality) before locking topology.
- For choice readability issues, pair with **Style** and **Scene**; if conflict persists, route via **Showrunner**.
- If a codex anchor would clarify affordance, signal **Curator** with a hook instead of stuffing exposition into a brief.

---

## 9) Anti-patterns (don’t do this)

- **Fake choice**: options that differ only in wording, not consequence.
- **Secret maze**: loops with no new affordance on return.
- **Meta gates** on surfaces: “Option locked: missing CODEWORD”.
- **Canon stuffing**: solving structure by revealing spoilers in briefs.
- **Keystone bottleneck**: a single brittle route to progress with no redundancy.

---

## 10) Mini-Checklist (run every time)

- [ ] TU scoped (slice, goals, timebox); neighbors pinged
- [ ] Hubs/loops designed with at least one **differentiated** return
- [ ] Gateways diegetic + fair; explicit **reachability** paths noted
- [ ] Section briefs enable drafting without guesswork
- [ ] Hooks filed for canon/codex/style dependencies
- [ ] Pre-gate self-check vs. **Reachability/Nonlinearity/Gateways/Presentation**

---

## 11) Tiny Examples

**Ambiguous pair → contrastive choices**

- Before: “Go left / Go right.”
- After: “Slip through maintenance / Face the foreman.”

**Meta gate → diegetic gate**

- Before: “Locked: missing CODEWORD.”
- After: “No union token on your lapel; the guard waves you back.”

**Loop with difference (note)**

- Return to Dock 7 after foreman encounter → **new affordance**: access to maintenance hatch if you overheard the crew code earlier.

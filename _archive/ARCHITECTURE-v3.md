# QuestFoundry v3: Integrated Cartridge Architecture

**Status:** Master Blueprint
**Version:** 3.3.0

---

## 1. Overview

QuestFoundry v3 replaces the layered specification model (L0-L5) with an **Integrated Domain Model** where MyST (Markedly Structured Text) documents serve as the Single Source of Truth for both machine execution and agent reasoning.

### Core Principle: The Hybrid Document

Every domain file serves two simultaneous runtimes:

```
MyST Source ─┬─(Compile)─→ Generated Code (Strict Constraints)
             │                       ↓
             └─(Ingest)──→ Agent Runtime (Context & Heuristics)
                                     │
                        Single Source of Truth
```

1. **Compiled (Directives):** Defines strict structures (schemas, graph edges, tools) for the Python runtime.
2. **Ingested (Prose):** Defines "soft" knowledge (anti-patterns, decision heuristics, checklists) for the LLM's context window (RAG).

### Orchestration Model

QuestFoundry uses **Showrunner-centric orchestration** where:

- **SR is the hub** — all delegation flows through the Showrunner
- **Roles are specialists** — each role has its own agent, prompt, and tools
- **Loops are guidance** — hybrid documents providing both graph constraints and playbook-style checklists
- **Dynamic delegation** — SR decides at runtime who to delegate to based on context

---

## 2. Directory Structure

The structure now explicitly separates **Content Workflows** (Loops) from **Operational Procedures** (Playbooks).

```
src/questfoundry/

    └── ...
```

### Loop vs. Playbook Distinction

> **Rule:** If it generates **Content Artifacts** (Scene, Lore, Hook), it is a **Loop**.
> If it manages **Studio Operations** (Recovery, Setup, Git Ops), it is a **Playbook**.

| Type | Purpose | Runtime Behavior | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Loops** | Create/Edit Story Content | SR uses as heuristic map for delegation | `story_spark`, `hook_harvest`, `scene_weave` |
| **Playbooks** | Fix/Setup the Studio | SR reads as "Emergency Manual" | `gate_failure`, `role_stuck`, `emergency_retcon` |

---

## 3. The Eight Roles

### Role Roster

| # | Role | Abbr | Archetype | Agency | Mandate |
|---|------|------|-----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | **Showrunner** | SR | Product Owner | High (Strategic) | "Manage by Exception" |
| 2 | **Lorekeeper** | LK | Librarian | Medium (Consistency) | "Maintain the Truth" |
| 3 | **Narrator** | NR | Dungeon Master | High (Improvisational) | "Run the Game" |
| 4 | **Publisher** | PB | Book Binder | Zero (Deterministic) | "Assemble the Artifact" |
| 5 | **Creative Director** | CD | Visionary | High (Aesthetic) | "Ensure Sensory Coherence" |
| 6 | **Plotwright** | PW | Architect | Medium (Structural) | "Design the Topology" |
| 7 | **Scene Smith** | SS | Writer | Medium (Creative) | "Fill with Prose" |
| 8 | **Gatekeeper** | GK | Auditor | Low (Validation) | "Enforce Quality Bars" |

---

## 4. State Model

### Three-Tier Storage Architecture

QuestFoundry uses a **three-tier storage model**:

| Tier | Persistence | Contains | Mutability |
|------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **hot_store** | Memory/checkpoint | Working drafts, process artifacts | Mutable |
| **cold_store** | SQLite + files | All approved content | Append-only |
| **Views/Exports** | Derived | Filtered snapshots | Read-only |

**Mindset: "Hot = discover & argue. Cold = agree & ship."**

#### Hot Store: Ephemeral Working Space

Hot store is internal working memory. Content here is **ephemeral** — it exists only during workflow execution and checkpoint recovery. When a workflow terminates, anything not promoted to cold_store is **lost**.

Artifacts marked `store: hot` in the domain ontology (e.g., `hook_card`, `brief`, `shotlist`, `audio_plan`) are **intentionally ephemeral**. They're planning/coordination artifacts that don't need permanent storage.

#### Cold Store: Permanent Canonical Record

Cold store is the permanent source of truth. Once content is promoted here, it becomes **canonical** and append-only. This is where player-facing content lives.

Artifacts marked `store: cold` or `store: both` in the domain ontology are **promotable**:

| Domain `store:` | Meaning | Examples |
|-----------------|---------|----------|
| `hot` | Always ephemeral, never promoted | hook_card, brief, shotlist |
| `cold` | Must end up in cold_store | canon_entry, character, location, event, fact |
| `both` | Starts in hot (drafting), promoted when approved | scene, act, chapter |

#### Promotion Flow

Only **Lorekeeper** writes to cold_store (via `promote_to_canon` tool). The promotion flow:

1. Specialist creates content in hot_store (e.g., Scene Smith writes scenes)
2. Gatekeeper validates quality bars
3. Lorekeeper promotes approved content to cold_store

**Key Distinction:**

- **Storage** (hot→cold): Determined by artifact type (`store:` field in domain ontology)
- **Export** (cold→view): Determined by `visibility` field per artifact

Publisher filters by `visibility` at export time for spoiler hygiene.

### StudioState (LangGraph Native)

```python
class StudioState(TypedDict):
    hot_store: dict[str, Artifact]      # Working drafts (mutable)
    cold_store: dict[str, Artifact]     # All approved canon (append-only)
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]
    current_role: str
    pending_intents: list[Intent]
```

### Cold Store Structure

```
cold_store/
├── Acts          # Structural organization
├── Chapters      # Content divisions (linked to acts)
├── Sections      # Prose content - scenes (linked to chapters)
├── Codex         # Player-safe encyclopedia (character, location, item, relationship)
├── Canon         # Internal world facts (canon_entry, event, fact, timeline)
├── Assets        # Binary files (metadata in DB, files on disk)
└── Snapshots     # Point-in-time captures
```

**Content Table Routing:**

| Artifact Type | Table | Description |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| scene | sections | Narrative prose |
| character, location, item, relationship | codex | Player-safe encyclopedia (NO spoilers) |
| canon_entry, event, fact, timeline | canon | Internal world facts (CAN have spoilers) |
| act | acts | Structural - groups chapters |
| chapter | chapters | Structural - groups scenes |

**Spoiler Handling:**

- **Codex** entries are ALWAYS player-safe (visibility: public by default)
- **Canon** entries have a `spoiler_level` field: `hot` (internal only) or `cold` (player-safe summary)

Each content artifact has a `visibility` field:

- `public` — Included in player exports
- `internal` — Author reference only
- `spoiler` — Excluded until player unlocks

### Stabilization Path

```
hot_store (draft) → Gatekeeper approval → cold_store (canon) → Publisher → Views
```

## 5. Protocol: SR-Orchestrated Handoff

The Showrunner (SR) is the sole orchestrator. Roles return `DelegationResult` objects to the SR.

```python
class DelegationResult(BaseModel):
    role_id: str
    status: str                         # e.g., "completed", "blocked"
    artifacts: list[str]                # IDs of artifacts created/modified
    message: str                        # Reasoning for SR
    recommendation: str | None = None   # Suggested next action
```

---

## 6. MyST Directive Vocabulary

All domain knowledge is encoded in **Hybrid Documents** using custom directives.

### 6.1 Role Directives (`domain/roles/*.md`)

**Hybrid Pattern:** Combines machine configuration (Directives) with the "Employee Handbook" (Prose).

#### Example Hybrid Structure

```markdown
# Plotwright

> **Mandate:** Design the Topology.

:::{role-meta}
id: plotwright
abbr: PW
archetype: Architect
agency: medium
:::

## Operational Guidelines (Context for Agent & Human)

**Decision Heuristics:**
- **Reachability:** If a scene is unreachable, prioritize fixing connections over writing prose.
- **Dormancy:** Stay dormant during `style_tune_up` unless called by SR.

**Anti-Patterns (DO NOT DO):**
- **Fake Choice:** Options that differ only in wording, not consequence.
- **Meta Gates:** Locking options with "Missing Key" text instead of diegetic narration.

## Configuration (Compiled to Code)

:::{role-tools}
- create_scene: "Define a structural container for prose"
- define_gate: "Set conditions for narrative access"
:::

:::{role-constraints}
- MUST NOT write final prose (delegate to Scene Smith)
- MUST ensure every node has at least one ingress path
:::

:::{role-prompt}
You are the {{ role.archetype }}.
Refer to "Operational Guidelines" for decision logic.
...
:::
```

### 6.2 Loop Directives (`domain/loops/*.md`)

**Hybrid Pattern:** Combines the workflow graph (Directives) with the execution checklist (formerly "Playbooks").

#### Example Hybrid Structure

```markdown
# Story Spark Loop

> **Goal:** Create meaningful nonlinearity from a story seed.

:::{loop-meta}
id: story_spark
trigger: user_request
entry_point: showrunner
:::

## Guidance (Formerly Playbook Checklist)

**When to trigger:**
- New chapter/story request from user.
- Fix reachability issues flagged by Gatekeeper.

**Success criteria:**
- At least 2 meaningful choices per scene.
- No dead-end paths without terminal markers.

**Common failure modes:**
- Single linear path (lacks nonlinearity).
- Orphaned scenes with no incoming edges.

## Execution Graph (Compiled for Validation)

:::{graph-node}
id: plotwright
role: plotwright
:::

:::{graph-edge}
source: plotwright
target: scene_smith
condition: "intent.status == 'topology_complete'"
:::

## Quality Gates

:::{quality-gate}
before: scene_smith
role: gatekeeper
bars: [reachability, nonlinearity]
blocking: true
:::
```

### 6.3 Ontology Directives (`domain/ontology/*.md`)

Defines data structures. Can also be Hybrid (e.g., adding "Usage Examples" prose).

#### Entity vs Embedded Artifacts

Artifacts fall into two categories based on their identity model:

| Aspect | Entity Artifacts | Embedded Artifacts (Value Objects) |
|--------|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Identity** | Independent ID, referenced by others | No independent identity |
| **Lifecycle** | Has status: draft → review → canon | None — exists with parent |
| **Storage** | Own rows in database | Embedded in parent's JSON blob |
| **Versioning** | Can be snapshotted independently | Versioned with parent |
| **Query** | Can query directly | Must query through parent |
| **Examples** | Scene, Character, CanonEntry | Choice, Gate |

**When to use Embedded:**

- Artifact has no meaning outside its parent (e.g., a Choice belongs to a specific Scene)
- Changes atomically with parent (never updated independently)
- Never queried or referenced directly by other artifacts
- No need for independent lifecycle tracking

**When to use Entity:**

- Referenced by multiple artifacts
- Needs independent versioning or status tracking
- Requires direct queries (e.g., "find all Characters in this story")
- Has its own lifecycle (draft, review, canon states)

**Domain Declaration:**

Embedded artifacts have `lifecycle: none` or omit lifecycle entirely, and their `store:` field indicates where the parent stores them (typically `both` for Scene children).

#### `{artifact-type}`

```markdown
:::{artifact-type}
id: hook_card
name: "Hook Card"
store: hot
:::
```

#### `{quality-bar}` (Updated)

Includes waiver policy for Gatekeeper reasoning.

```markdown
:::{quality-bar}
id: integrity
name: "Integrity"
checks: ["All facts traceable"]
waiver_policy: "Allowed only for Retcons approved by SR with 'emergency_retcon' playbook."
:::
```

---

## 7. Generated Code Patterns

The compiler extracts directives to generate:

1. `generated/roles/{role}.py` (Configuration)
2. `generated/models/artifacts.py` (Pydantic Models)
3. `generated/loops/{loop}.py` (Graph Metadata - optional, mostly for SR context)

The **Prose** sections are not compiled but are indexed for the Agent's RAG/Context system.

### CRITICAL: The Compiler Workflow

> **WARNING:** Files in `generated/` are AUTO-GENERATED. Direct edits to these files
> cause regressions that are difficult to debug. This mistake has been made repeatedly.

**The correct workflow for domain changes:**

```bash
# 1. Identify the source file
#    generated/roles/plotwright.py → domain/roles/plotwright.md
#    generated/models/artifacts.py → domain/ontology/artifacts.md

# 2. Edit the source (MyST) file
vim src/questfoundry/domain/roles/plotwright.md

# 3. Regenerate via compiler
qf compile

# 4. Review and commit both source AND generated
git add src/questfoundry/domain/ src/questfoundry/generated/
git commit -m "fix(domain): update plotwright role"
```

**If you find a bug in generated code:**

1. **DO NOT** fix the generated file directly
2. Find the source file in `domain/` or fix the compiler in `compiler/`
3. Run `qf compile` to regenerate
4. Verify the fix appears in the generated output

**Source → Generated mapping:**

| Source Location | Generated Output |
|-----------------|------------------|
| `domain/roles/*.md` | `generated/roles/*.py` |
| `domain/ontology/artifacts.md` | `generated/models/artifacts.py` |
| `domain/ontology/enums.md` | `generated/models/enums.py` |
| `domain/loops/*.md` | `generated/loops/*.py` |

## 8. Agent Prompt Pattern: Menu + Consult

Role prompts follow the **Menu + Consult** pattern to minimize prompt size while ensuring agents know how to find information.

### Core Principle

```
System Prompt (small) ──→ Tells agent WHAT exists (menu)
                    └──→ Tells agent HOW to look up details (consult tools)

Agent Runtime ──→ Calls consult_* tools to get full details when needed
```

### Prompt Structure

Each role's system prompt contains:

1. **Identity** — Brief archetype and mandate
2. **Constraints** — Role-specific behavioral rules
3. **Primary Artifact Types** — What this role typically creates
4. **Tool List** — Available tools with one-line descriptions
5. **Artifact Menu** — All valid artifact types (not invented ones)
6. **Workflow** — Minimal steps emphasizing "consult first, then write"

### The Artifact Menu

Roles see a menu of **available artifact types**:

```markdown
## Available Artifact Types

- **brief**: Work order from SR to specialist role
- **scene**: Narrative unit with content, gates, choices
- **hook_card**: Story hook that captures change/event
- **canon_entry**: Validated fact in cold store
- **gatecheck_report**: Quality validation results (Gatekeeper only)

Use `consult_schema(artifact_type)` to see required/optional fields.
```

This prevents models from inventing artifact names like `story_topology` or `section_draft`.

### Role-to-Artifact Mapping

Each role has primary artifact types it typically creates:

| Role | Primary Artifacts |
|------|-------------------|
| Showrunner | `brief` |
| Plotwright | `scene` |
| Scene Smith | `scene` |
| Lorekeeper | `canon_entry` |
| Gatekeeper | `gatecheck_report` |
| Creative Director | `scene` |
| Narrator | `scene` |
| Publisher | *(assembles, doesn't create)* |

The prompt tells each role: "You typically create: `scene`. **FIRST STEP**: Call `consult_schema("scene")` to see required fields before writing."

### Consult Tools

Three tools provide detailed lookup:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `consult_schema(artifact_type)` | Get required/optional fields for an artifact |
| `consult_playbook(loop_id)` | Get workflow guidance for a loop |
| `consult_role_charter(role_id)` | Learn about another role's capabilities |

### Why Menu + Consult?

1. **Smaller prompts** — Less token usage, faster inference
2. **Always current** — Details come from compiled source, not stale prompt text
3. **Tool-using behavior** — Agents learn to look things up, not guess
4. **Explicit guidance** — "Call consult_schema FIRST" prevents schema errors

### Implementation

Located in `runtime/roles.py`:

- `_get_artifact_menu()` — Generates the artifact type menu
- `ROLE_PRIMARY_ARTIFACTS` — Maps roles to their output artifact types
- `_get_role_artifact_hint()` — Generates "Your Primary Artifact Types" section
- `_render_prompt()` — Assembles the minimal prompt with menu + consult guidance

## 9. Runtime Architecture

### 9.1 Core Components

- **Orchestrator:** SR-centric delegation hub using LangGraph
- **State:** `StudioState` TypedDict with hot_store, cold_store, messages
- **Tools:** Role-specific tool classes with state injection

### 9.2 Tool Response Pattern

> **Rule:** Tools must return clear verdicts, not guidance for the LLM to interpret.

When tools return ambiguous responses (criteria lists, instructions asking the LLM to "analyze"), the LLM retries repeatedly hoping for a definitive answer. This causes infinite loops.

**Anti-Pattern (causes retry loops):**

```json
{
  "bar": "style",
  "artifact_content": {...},
  "evaluation_criteria": ["Check voice", "Verify tone"],
  "instruction": "Analyze and determine if it passes."
}
```

**Correct Pattern:**

```json
{
  "bar": "style",
  "artifact_id": "scene_001",
  "passed": true,
  "issues": [],
  "notes": "Style evaluation passed - voice consistent.",
  "next_step": "Record result and proceed to create_gatecheck_report."
}
```

**Key requirements:**

1. **Always return a verdict:** `passed`, `failed`, `error`, or similar boolean/enum
2. **List specific issues:** Empty list = no issues (not "check yourself")
3. **Provide next_step:** Tell the LLM what to do with this result
4. **Never delegate interpretation:** The tool does the work, not the caller

### 9.3 Prompt Composition Pattern

> **Rule:** Separate domain knowledge from runtime enforcement.

Agent prompts are composed from two distinct layers:

```
Domain Layer (from MyST)     Runtime Layer (prompts.py)
├── Role identity            ├── Tool call format examples
├── Mandate & constraints    ├── Artifact handoff patterns
├── Anti-patterns            ├── Stop condition reminders
└── Jinja2 template          └── LLM-specific nudges
         │                            │
         └──────────┬─────────────────┘
                    ▼
            Final System Prompt
```

**Domain layer** comes from the `{role-prompt}` directive in MyST files. It defines WHAT the role is and SHOULD do.

**Runtime layer** is in `runtime/prompts.py`. It defines HOW to enforce behavior with LLM-specific techniques.

**Key file:** `src/questfoundry/runtime/prompts.py`

```python
from questfoundry.runtime.prompts import build_sr_prompt

prompt = build_sr_prompt(roles)  # Composes domain + runtime
```

**Anti-pattern (don't do this):**

```python
# BAD: Hardcoded prompt mixing domain and runtime concerns
def _build_sr_system_prompt():
    return """You are the Showrunner...
    [100 lines of duplicated domain knowledge]
    [Mixed with LLM-specific enforcement]
    """
```

**Correct pattern:**

```python
# GOOD: Load domain template, add runtime nudges
def build_sr_prompt(roles):
    domain = render_role_template(roles["showrunner"])
    runtime = SR_RUNTIME_NUDGES  # Tool examples, enforcement
    return f"{domain}\n\n{runtime}"
```

### 9.4 Validate-with-Feedback Pattern

> **Rule:** When tool validation fails, return structured feedback and let the LLM retry.

The executor implements a **validate-with-feedback** pattern for all tool calls. When validation fails:

1. **DO NOT** silently terminate execution
2. **DO** return a structured error to the LLM with actionable guidance
3. **DO** continue the execution loop so the LLM can correct its mistake

**Error Response Format:**

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Brief description of what went wrong",
  "error_count": 1,
  "invalid_fields": [
    {
      "field": "status",
      "provided": "pass",
      "issue": "'pass' is not a valid status value"
    }
  ],
  "valid_statuses": ["completed", "passed", "failed", "blocked", "needs_review", "error"],
  "hint": "Use 'completed' for finished work, 'passed'/'failed' for quality gates..."
}
```

**Key elements:**

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `success: false` | Signals validation failure |
| `error` | Brief description of what went wrong |
| `error_count` | Number of validation errors |
| `invalid_fields` | Which fields failed and why (what was provided, what's wrong) |
| `missing_fields` | Required fields not provided |
| `valid_*` / `optional_*` | What values ARE valid (so LLM knows what to use) |
| `hint` | Actionable guidance including which consult tool to use |

**Executor Behavior (executor.py):**

When a "stop tool" (like `return_to_sr` or `terminate`) returns `success: false`:

```python
# CORRECT: Only terminate when validation succeeds
if parsed.get("success", True):
    found_done = True
    done_result = parsed
else:
    # Validation failed - continue loop for retry
    # ToolMessage with error is already appended
    any_failed = True  # Increments failure_count
```

**Anti-Pattern (DO NOT DO):**

```python
# WRONG: Terminate on any stop tool call
if tool_name in self.stop_tool_names:
    found_done = True  # Terminates even on validation failure!
```

**Why This Matters:**

Without validate-with-feedback, a role that uses an invalid status value (e.g., "pass" instead of "passed") will:

1. Have its error message discarded
2. Execution terminates with a confusing "completed" status
3. Subsequent roles are never called
4. Debugging is difficult because the root cause is hidden

With validate-with-feedback:

1. Error message is fed back to the LLM
2. LLM sees what went wrong and what values are valid
3. LLM retries with corrected value
4. Execution continues normally

**Implementation Files:**

- `runtime/executor.py` — Loop continues when stop tool returns `success: false`
- `runtime/tools/role.py` — `return_to_sr` returns structured validation errors
- `runtime/validation.py` — Artifact validation with LLM-friendly feedback

## 10. Build Pipeline

```
1. Parse MyST files
2. Extract Directives -> Compile to Python
3. Extract Prose -> Index for Agent Context (JSON/Vector)
```

## 11. Quality Bars (v3)

| Bar | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Integrity** | No contradictions in canon |
| **Reachability** | All content accessible via valid paths |
| **Nonlinearity** | Multiple valid paths exist |
| **Gateways** | All gates have valid unlock conditions |
| **Style** | Voice and tone consistency |
| **Determinism** | Same inputs → same outputs |
| **Presentation** | Formatting and structure |
| **Accessibility** | Content usable by all players |

## 13. v2 → v3 Migration Inventory & Priorities

> **Status:** Triaged
> **Strategy:** Hybrid Consolidation

This section tracks the migration of v2 content into the v3 Hybrid structure. Items are grouped by priority to inform the Implementation Plan (Chapter 13).

### 12.1 Solved by Architecture (No Migration Needed)

| Gap | v2 Content | v3 Solution | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Role Depth** | Charters (Anti-patterns, etc.) | **Hybrid Role Files** (Prose + Directives) | ✅ DEFINED |
| **Loops vs Playbooks** | Overlapping Docs | **Loops Eat Playbooks** (Content) + **Playbooks** (Ops) | ✅ DEFINED |
| **Protocol Envelope** | Header Spec | **DelegationResult** (Python Object) | ✅ FIXED |
| **Static Flows** | Message choreography | **SR Dynamic Orchestration** | ✅ FIXED |

### 12.2 Priority 1: Critical (Must Have for Functionality)

*Without these, the system is unsafe or unaware of how to fix itself.*

**1. Principles (New Directory)**
Create `domain/principles/` and migrate:

- [x] `SPOILER_HYGIENE.md` (Gatekeeper requires this to audit safety)
- [x] `PN_PRINCIPLES.md` (Narrator requires this to run the game)
- [x] `SOURCES_OF_TRUTH.md` (Defines what "Canon" actually means)

**2. Operational Playbooks (New Directory)**
Create `domain/playbooks/` for meta-processes:

- [x] `gate_failure.md` (How SR recovers when blocked by GK)
- [x] `emergency_retcon.md` (How to rewrite cold canon safely)
- [x] `role_stuck.md` (Agent reset procedure)
- [x] `world_genesis.md` (Project setup)

### 12.3 Priority 2: High (Backlog - Standard Content)

*Required for a full production studio, but not for the initial "Story Spark".*

**3. Remaining Content Loops (Consolidated)**
Migrate remaining v2 Loops + Playbook checklists into `domain/loops/`:

- [x] `hook_harvest.md` (Triage process)
- [x] `lore_deepening.md` (Canon generation)
- [x] `canon_commit.md` (The "Hot to Cold" merge process)
- [x] `scene_weave.md` (Drafting prose)
- [x] `codex_expansion.md` (Encyclopedia generation)

**4. Core Artifacts (Ontology)**
Migrate essential missing artifacts to `domain/ontology/artifacts.md`:

- [x] **Entities:** `Character`, `Location`, `Item`, `Relationship`
- [x] **Structural:** `Act`, `Chapter`, `Sequence`, `Beat`
- [x] **World:** `Timeline`, `Event`, `Fact`

### 12.4 Priority 3: Medium (Enrichment)

*Adds depth and polish.*

**5. Role Enrichment**

- [x] Manually port "Anti-patterns" and "Example Dialogues" from v2 Charters to v3 Role files.

**6. Remaining Artifacts**

- [x] `Shotlist`, `AudioPlan`, `TranslationPack` (Asset production types)

**7. Glossary**

- [x] Create `domain/ontology/glossary.md` (Lightweight version of v2 glossary).

### Current Status: Story Spark Loop ✓

**Milestone (2025-12-09):** First successful end-to-end Story Spark execution with cold_store promotion.

The workflow now correctly chains:

```
Plotwright → Gatekeeper → Lorekeeper → cold_store snapshot
```

Verified: `qf ask` creates content, validates it, and promotes to canon.

### Next Step: Lore Deepening Loop

**Goal:** Enable continuation of existing stories by reading from cold_store, enriching through the loop, and writing back.

**Critical capability gap:** The current workflow starts fresh each time. For lore deepening, we need:

1. **Read from cold** — Load existing canon as context for continuation
2. **Process through loop** — Run lore_deepening workflow (already defined in `domain/loops/`)
3. **Write back to cold** — Merge new content with existing canon

**Domain knowledge review needed:**

- How does `read_cold_sot` present existing content to roles?
- How do roles distinguish "continuing" vs "creating from scratch"?
- What's the merge strategy when new content overlaps with existing canon?

### Known Technical Debt

**SR Prompt in Runtime (orchestrator.py)**

The Showrunner's prompt is currently hardcoded in `runtime/orchestrator.py` (`_build_sr_system_prompt()`). This violates the domain-first principle - the workflow guidance (GK→LK promotion flow) should be in `domain/roles/showrunner.md` and compiled/loaded from there.

*TODO:* Refactor to load SR prompt from domain layer, similar to how other role prompts are handled via `_render_prompt()` in `runtime/roles.py`.

## 15. VCR-Style Testing

QuestFoundry captures structured logs that enable "VCR" (Video Cassette Recorder) style testing — recording LLM interactions for isolated role replay.

### Log Format

When `--log` is specified (with `--project`), `{project}/logs/llm.jsonl` captures complete LLM sessions:

```jsonl
{"event": "role_session_start", "role": "gatekeeper", "task": "Validate story structure", "system_prompt": "...", "session_id": "a1b2c3d4"}
{"event": "llm_request", "iteration": 1, "messages": [...], "session_id": "a1b2c3d4"}
{"event": "llm_response", "content": "...", "tool_calls": [...], "duration_ms": 1234}
{"event": "tool_execution", "tool": "consult_schema", "args": {...}, "result": "..."}
{"event": "llm_request", "iteration": 2, "messages": [...]}
{"event": "llm_response", "content": "...", "has_tool_calls": false}
{"event": "role_session_end", "role": "gatekeeper", "status": "completed", "duration_ms": 5678}
```

### Extracting a Role Session

Filter by `session_id` to isolate one role's execution:

```bash
# Extract all events for session a1b2c3d4
jq 'select(.session_id == "a1b2c3d4")' myproject/logs/llm.jsonl

# Get just the first LLM request (system + user message)
jq 'select(.event == "role_session_start")' myproject/logs/llm.jsonl
```

### Replaying to an LLM (curl example)

Extract the messages from a logged request and replay to Ollama:

```bash
# 1. Extract the first request's messages
jq -r 'select(.event == "llm_request" and .iteration == 1) | .messages' myproject/logs/llm.jsonl | head -1 > /tmp/messages.json

# 2. Build the Ollama request
cat <<EOF > /tmp/replay.json
{
  "model": "qwen3:32b",
  "messages": $(cat /tmp/messages.json),
  "stream": false
}
EOF

# 3. Send to Ollama
curl -s http://localhost:11434/api/chat -d @/tmp/replay.json | jq '.message.content'
```

For OpenAI-compatible APIs:

```bash
curl -s https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": '"$(cat /tmp/messages.json)"'
  }' | jq '.choices[0].message.content'
```

### Use Cases

1. **Debugging** — Replay a failing role session to understand LLM behavior
2. **Regression Testing** — Compare outputs before/after prompt changes
3. **Cost Optimization** — Test prompt changes against recorded sessions offline
4. **Unit Testing** — Mock LLM responses for deterministic role tests

## 16. Checkpointing

QuestFoundry supports per-delegation checkpointing for workflow state persistence.

### Storage

Checkpoints are stored in SQLite at `{project}/checkpoints.db`. Delete this file to clear all checkpoints.

```
project_1/
├── project.qfdb           # Cold store
├── checkpoints.db         # Checkpoint store
└── logs/                  # Debug logs (--log flag)
```

### Run Identification

Each workflow execution is assigned a unique run ID: `run-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN`

Example: `run-2025-12-09-001`, `run-2025-12-09-002`

### Checkpoint Granularity

Checkpoints are saved after each delegation completes. Each checkpoint captures:

- **hot_store** — Full state dictionary
- **sr_messages** — Showrunner's conversation history
- **role_messages** — Last delegated role's conversation history
- **delegation_history** — List of all completed delegations
- **sr_turn** — Current turn number

### CLI Usage

```bash
# New run (checkpoints auto-saved when --project is specified)
qf ask "Create a story" --project myproject

# Resume from latest checkpoint of a run
qf ask "Continue" --project myproject --resume run-2025-12-09-001

# Resume from specific checkpoint ID
qf ask "Continue" --project myproject --from-checkpoint 5
```

### Use Cases

1. **Development Iteration** — Restart from a known checkpoint after modifying prompts
2. **Recovery** — Resume after crash/timeout without losing progress
3. **Debugging** — Inspect state at specific points in workflow execution

### Implementation Files

- `runtime/checkpoint.py` — `CheckpointStore` class and data models
- `runtime/orchestrator.py` — Checkpoint save/load integration
- `runtime/cli/main.py` — `--resume` and `--from-checkpoint` flags

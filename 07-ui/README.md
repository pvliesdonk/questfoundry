# Layer 7 — UI (User Interfaces)

**Status:** 🚧 Planning Phase
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-31

## Overview

Layer 7 provides user interfaces for authors and players. The initial implementation focuses on a CLI tool that wraps Layer 6 library functionality.

## Purpose

- Provide author tools for running loops, managing TUs, generating artifacts
- Enable manual loop execution and individual role invocation
- Support quickstart workflow with checkpoints
- Generate and export views for players
- Offer interactive mode for conversational collaboration with AI agents

## Repository

**Primary Implementation:** `pvliesdonk/questfoundry-cli` (Python CLI)

This directory (`07-ui/`) in the spec repo contains:
- UX design documentation
- Command specifications
- Future UI concepts (TUI, GUI, WebUI, MCP server)

The actual implementation lives in the separate CLI repository.

## CLI Architecture

## Interaction Modes

### Guided Mode (Default, MVP)

**Loop-by-Loop Checkpoints:**

```bash
$ qf quickstart

Welcome to QuestFoundry!

Setting up your project...

? What's your story premise?
> A detective investigates mysterious disappearances in a coastal town

? What tone?
> Mystery with supernatural elements

? Target length?
> Short (2-3 hours gameplay)

Creating project: coastal-mystery.qfproj

- Automatic summary of what just happened
- Optional detailed review before continuing
- Clear indication of which loop is next

### Interactive Mode

**Conversational Collaboration:**

```bash
$ qf quickstart --interactive

Welcome to QuestFoundry Interactive Mode!

In this mode, AI agents can ask you questions as they work.
You can respond naturally and guide the creative process.

Starting Hook Harvest loop...

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

[Lore Weaver]: I'm analyzing your premise. I see potential for
both cosmic horror and psychological thriller elements.

Question: Should the supernatural elements be:
  a) Ambiguous (possibly explained naturally)
  b) Clearly supernatural
  c) Something else?

Your answer: Let's keep it ambiguous until midgame, then reveal
cosmic horror elements gradually

[Lore Weaver]: Perfect! That gives us great narrative tension.
I'll seed hooks that work both ways...

[Lore Weaver]: For HOOK-003 about local folklore, I'm torn
between two approaches:

Question: Should "the Calling" be:
  - An old sailor's superstition (builds misdirection)
  - A recent phenomenon (increases urgency)

Your answer: recent phenomenon

[Lore Weaver]: Got it. Creating hooks now...

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ Hook Harvest complete (5 hooks created)

Continue? [Y/n]:
```

**Agent Questions Implementation:**
- Agents use `ask_human()` API (Layer 6)
- Creates `human.question` intent (Layer 4)
- CLI displays question with context
- Human responds free-form
- Response sent as `human.response` intent
- Agent continues with answer

### Express Mode (Future)

**Fully Autonomous:**

```bash
$ qf quickstart --express

Express Mode: Fully autonomous execution

? Story premise: [...]
? Tone: [...]
? Length: [...]

Running full production...

This may take 15-30 minutes. You can safely close this window.
Progress will be saved and you can check status with: qf status

$ qf generate audio CUELIST-001 --provider elevenlabs --voice rachel
```

### Artifact Inspection

```bash
$ qf list hooks

Hooks (8 total)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
ID         Status      Stakes  Title
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
HOOK-001   canonized   5       The lighthouse keeper's log
HOOK-002   canonized   4       Strange tidal patterns
HOOK-003   in-progress 4       Local folklore
HOOK-004   proposed    3       Missing persons pattern
...

$ qf show HOOK-001

Hook Card: HOOK-001
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Title:    The lighthouse keeper's final log entry
Status:   canonized
Stakes:   5 (out of 5)
Created:  2025-10-31 by Lore Weaver
TU:       TU-2025-10-31-LW01

Description:
  The last entry in keeper Samuel Morrison's log is dated
  the night before his disappearance. It describes "the song
  from the deep" and mentions coordinates.

Implications:
  - Provides concrete lead (coordinates)
  - Establishes pattern (disappearances + song)
  - Creates urgency (recent incident)

Gateway Conditions:
  - Player must visit lighthouse
  - Player must find log (hidden)

Linked Canon:
  → CANON-001: Samuel Morrison backstory
  → CANON-005: The Calling origins

Player-Safe: Yes (marked for Codex)
```

### Quality Checks

```bash
$ qf check

Running Gatekeeper validation...

from questfoundry.orchestration import Showrunner
from questfoundry import ProtocolClient

def run_loop(loop_name: str, interactive: bool = False):
    client = ProtocolClient(workspace=current_project)
    showrunner = Showrunner(client, interactive=interactive)

    # Execute loop
    result = showrunner.run_loop(loop_name)

    # Display results
    display_loop_summary(result)
```

## Next Steps

1. ⏸️ Create `pvliesdonk/questfoundry-cli` repository
